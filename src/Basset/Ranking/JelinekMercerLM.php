/**
 * JelinekMercerLM is a class for ranking documents against a query based on Linear interpolation of the maximum 
 * likelihood model.
 *
 * From Chengxiang Zhai and John Lafferty. 2001. A study of smoothing methods for language models applied
 * to Ad Hoc information retrieval. In Proceedings of the 24th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on 
 * Research and development in information retrieval (SIGIR '01).
 * http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.94.8019&rep=rep1&type=pdf
 * The value for λ is generally very small (0.1) for title queries and around 0.7 for verbose.
