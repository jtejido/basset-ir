 * In computing, stop words are words which are filtered out before or after processing of natural language data (text).
 * Though "stop words" usually refers to the most common words in a language, there is no single universal list of stop 
 * words used by all natural language processing tools, and indeed not all tools even use such a list. Some tools 
 * specifically avoid removing these stop words to support phrase search.
 *
 * This class transforms tokens. If they are listed as stop words
 * it returns null in order for the Document to remove them.
 * Otherwise it leaves them unchanged.
