theories of plastic buckling ..Abatdorf,s.b..Bj. ae. scs. 16, 1949, 405..Wtheories of plastic buckling .  the theory for the plastic buckling of columns which appearsfinally to have achieved a satisfactory form, rests upon thewell-established uniaxial stress-strain relation .  the development ofa correspondingly satisfactory theory for the plastic buckling ofplates has been hampered by the nonexistence of an establishedpolyaxial stress-strain relation in the plastic range .  present theories for the polyaxial stress-strain relation beyondthe elastic range can be divided into two types, often called flowand deformation theories .  theories of plastic buckling based ondeformation theories are in better agreement with experimentthan those based on flow theories .  on the other hand, tests inwhich a material is compressed into the plastic range and thensubjected to shear at constant compressive stress are in betteragreement with flow than with deformation theories .  legitimatedoubt therefore has existed as to the validity of any theory forthe plastic buckling of plates .  as a result of studying these apparent contradictions, a newtheory of plasticity has been developed which is of neither theflow nor the deformation type .  it is based upon the concept ofslip, and its formulation was guided more by physical, and lessby mathematical, considerations than previous theories .experimental evidence of limited scope but of crucial character is inbetter agreement with the new theory than with either flow ordeformation theories .  the new theory accounts for the apparentcontradictions previously alluded to and justifies the use ofdeformation theory in the analysis of the plastic buckling of plates .
