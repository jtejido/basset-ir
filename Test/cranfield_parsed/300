on a particular class of similar solutions of the equationsof motion and energy of a viscous fluid ..Areeves,b.l. and kippenhan,c.j..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962..Won a particular class of similar solutions of the equationsof motion and energy of a viscous fluid .  by introducing the similarity concept to the two-dimensional,incompressible navier-stokes equations and energy equation, aparticular class of solutions is found .  two general types of flowsare considered ..  (1) laminar free convection--i.e., flows whichtake place due to a body force--and (2) laminar forcedconvection .  for free convection on vertical plates, similar solutions areobtained for two different power-law surface temperaturevariations, and it is shown that one of these solutions constitutes anew type of boundary problem .  results of numericalintegrations of the equations are compared with solutions of the similarboundary-layer equations for free convection, and it isdemonstrated that a range of surface temperature variations exists forwhich the boundary layer equations are no longer valid .  for forced convection, it is shown that the use of similaritytransformations provides an alternate method of deriving theordinary differential equations for some well-known solutions,such as couette and stagnation point flows .  solutions areobtained for radial converging or diverging flows between planesurfaces when the temperatures of the surfaces vary as arbitrarypowers of the distance from the orgin .  results of numericalintegrations of the ordinary differential equations are presentedfor prandtl numbers of 0.01 and 1.0 and for linear surfacetemperature variations .  some rather surprising results are obtainedfor diverging flows when separation occurs and some revealingcomparisons with results from boundary-layer theory are made .
