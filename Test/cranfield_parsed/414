the problem of resistance in compressible fluids ..Avon karman,t..B5th volta cong. 1955,226..Wthe problem of resistance in compressible fluids .  this report is restricted to theresistance of bodies of revolution andof cylindrical bodies of infinite lengthmoving with uniform velocity ina compressible fluid .  in the case of bodiesof revolution it will be assumedthat the direction of the movement isparallel to the axis of symmetry .it will be assumed that the fluid satisfiesthe equation of state of perfectgases, i. e. const., where p denotesthe pressure, the density andt the absolute temperature .  in additionto obeying this equation thefluid is characterized by the statementthat the intrinsic energy of theunit mass amounts to where forsimplicity's sake the specific heatwill be expressed in work ratherthan heat units .  the ratio betweenthe specific heat at constant pressureand the specific heat at constantvolume will be denoted by .  it isknown that the value of x dependsupon the number of degrees of freedomof the molecules,. if this numberis denoted by n .  for airthe value x = 1.4 will be used .the limiting case x = 1 willbe referred to as that of aassumed that in the rangeconsidered and are independent ofthe temperature .
