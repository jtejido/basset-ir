allowable axial loads and bending moments for inelastic structuresunder nonuniform temperature distribution ..Ab. e. gatewood and r. w. gehring.Bthe ohio state university and north american aviation, inc..Wallowable axial loads and bending moments for inelastic structuresunder nonuniform temperature distribution .a strain-analysis method is derived and demonstrated for thecalculation of design allowable load-strain curves for the cross sectionof a structure supporting axial loads and bending moments .  thetemperature effects of thermal stresses and changed material propertiesand all inelastic effects are included in the calculations so thatthe final curve is a design curve for the applied stresses as calculatedby room-temperature elastic procedures .  the method allows for sequenceapplication and removal of load and temperature, as well as cyclingof load and/or temperature .  applications are shown for a rectangularbar under temperature cycling with axial loads and/or bending momentsand for a box beam with one bending-moment temperature cycle .interaction curves beyween axial load and bending moment with inelasticeffects included are given, the calculations being done on a digitalcomputer .  a procedure is given for using the method to constructdesign curves .
