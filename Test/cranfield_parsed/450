some physical interpretations of magnetohydrodynamic duct flows ..Afujihiko sakao.Buniversity of tokyo, tokyo, japan.Wsome physical interpretations of magnetohydrodynamic duct flows .this note presents some physical interpretations of magnetohydrodynamicduct flows with various boundary conditions viewed in the light of theeffects of conducting walls on the pattern of electric current, takingexamples from published results on rectangular ducts .  the currentpatterns are illustrated in fig. 1 for rectangular ducts havingvarious combinations of conducting and nonconducting walls, a uniformmagnetic field being applied in the horizontal direction .
