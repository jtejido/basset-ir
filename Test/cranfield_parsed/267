steady and transient free convection of an electricallyconducting fluid from a vertical plate in the presenceof a magnetic field ..Agupta,s..Bapp. sc. res. 9, 1959..Wsteady and transient free convection of an electricallyconducting fluid from a vertical plate in the presenceof a magnetic field .  an analysis is made for the laminarfree convection and heat transfer ofa viscous electrically conducting fluidfrom a hot vertical plate in the casewhen the induced field is negligiblecompared to the imposed magnetic field .it is found that similar solutions forvelocity and temperature exist whenthe imposed magnetic field (actingperpendicular to the plate) varies inverselyas the fourth root of the distance fromthe lowest end of the plate .  explicitexpressions for velocity, temperature,boundary layer thickness and nusseltnumber are obtained and the effectof a magnetic field on them is studied .it is found that the effect of themagnetic field is to decrease the rate ofheat transfer from the wall .  in thesecond part, the method of characteristicsis employed to obtain solutions ofthe time-dependent hydromagnetic freeconvection equations (hyperbolic) ofmomentum and energy put into integralform .  the results yield the time requiredfor the steady flow to be established,and the effect of the magnetic field on this time is studied .
