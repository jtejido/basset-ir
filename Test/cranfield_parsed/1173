the buckling of cylindrical shells under longitudinally varying loads ..Av. i. weingarten.Bspace technology laboratories, inc., los angeles, calif.now with aerospace corp., los angeles, calif..Wthe buckling of cylindrical shells under longitudinally varying loads .two problems illustrating the effect of nonuniformity of loadingon the buckling characteristics of circular cylinders areinvestigated .  the first problem deals with the effect oflinearly varying axial compressive stress, such as would beproduced by the weight of the propellant in a solid-propellantengine case .  the results indicate that the ratio of the maximumcritical compressive stress induced by the shear load to thecritical uniform compressive stress varies from 1.9 forthe curvature parameter z equal to 1.6 as zbecomes infinite .  in particular, the increase in stress isless than 20 per sq. ft. for z greater than 100 .the stability of thin cylinders loaded by lateral externalpressure varying linearly in the longitudinal direction is alsoinvestigated .  the results indicate that for z greater than 100,the buckling coefficients are proportional to squareroot z .
