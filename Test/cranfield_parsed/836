analytical and experimental investigation of stress distributions inlong flat plates subjected to lingitudinal loads and transversetemperature gradients ..Asprague, g.h. and huang, p.c..Bwadc tr 55-350, 1955 ..Wanalytical and experimental investigation of stress distributions inlong flat plates subjected to lingitudinal loads and transversetemperature gradients .stress and strain distributions were studied in long flat plates inorder to develop practical analytical procedures for the designanalysis of aircraft structures at elevated temperatures .various load-temperature conditions are presented . these include ..methods of analysis for calculation of stress distributions underand plastic range,.ture .experimental verification of the analytical procedures is shown withcomparisons between the use of constant room temperature or temperaturedependent values of modulus of elasticity and coefficient of thermalexpansion .the test specimen, equipment, instrumentation, and experimental programare discussed in detail . experimental data obtained from the specimenand associated material control coupon tests are presented .
