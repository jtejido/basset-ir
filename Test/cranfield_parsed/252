an investigation of interference effects on similar models ofdifferent size in various transonic tunnels in the u.k. ..Af. o/hara and l. c. squire, r.a.e..Band a. b. haines, a.r.a..Wan investigation of interference effects on similar models ofdifferent size in various transonic tunnels in the u.k. .details are given of a programme of tests being made on similarswept-wing models in transonic tunnels of different types .  force measurementresults at subsonic speeds in the r.a.e. 3 ft. by 3 ft. slotted tunnelshow only small interference effects for models of moderate blockageat low incidence., at higher incidences, the interference effect onlift becomes appreciably greater than estimated by theory, andsignificant pitching moment differences occur, apparently due to wallinterference on the wing flow field .  comparable but smaller effectsare evident in the results from the a.r.a. 9 ft. by 8 ft. perforatedtunnel .  at speeds just above m = 1, the force fluctuates as speedis increased, because of wave reflection interference .  the magnitudeof the fluctuations diminishes as speed is further increased and thisreduction is more marked in the perforated tunnel .  pressuremeasurements along the top of the body at zero incidence show delay inshock movements at high subsonic speeds indicating a blockage effecton speed., the effect is larger in the perforated tunnel thoughsmaller than predicted by theory .  above m = 1, both expansion andshock waves are strongly reflected in the slotted tunnel butconsiderable alleviation, particularly of shock waves, is achievedin the perforated tunnel, for which an analysis of the effects isgiven, showing for example, the effect of the open-area distribution ofthe walls .
