experimental and theoretical studies of axisymmetric free jets ..Alove, e.s. et al..Bnasa tr r-6, 1959 ..Wexperimental and theoretical studies of axisymmetric free jets .some experimental and theoretical studies have been made of axisymmetric free jets exhausting from sonic and supersonic nozzles into still airand into supersonic streams with a view toward problems associated withpropulsive jets and the investigation of these problems .for jets exhausting into still air, consideration is given to theeffects of jet mach number, nozzle divergence angle, and jetstatic-pressure ratio upon jet structure, jet wavelength, and the shape andcurvature of the jet boundary . studies of the effects of the ratio ofspecific heats of the jets are included as are observations pertainingto jet noise and jet simulation .for jets exhausting into supersonic streams, an attempt has been made to present primarily theoretical curves of the type that may be useful inevaluating certain jet interference effects and in formulatingexperimental studies . the primary variables considered are jet mach number,free-stream mach number, jet static-pressure ratio, ratio of specificheats of the jet, nozzle exit angle, and boattail angle . the simulation problem and the case of a hypothetical hypersonic vehicle are examined
