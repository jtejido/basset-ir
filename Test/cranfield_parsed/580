new thermo-mechanical reciprocity relations with applicationto thermal stress analysis ..A biot,m.a..Bj. ae. scs. 26, 1959..Wnew thermo-mechanical reciprocity relations with applicationto thermal stress analysis .  based on the variational formulation of linearthermodynamics as developed previously by the writer, thermomechanicalreciprocity relations are discussed which lead to new methods ofanalysis of thermal stresses .  these reciprocity relations are quitedifferent from the usual ones derived from the analogy of thermalloading with a combination of surface and body-force distribution .the results are applicable to stationary and transienttemperatures in elastic and viscoelastic structures .  the methods areentirely variational and do not require the evaluation of thetemperature field .  the stresses at one point are expresseddirectly in terms of any arbitrary distribution temperatures appliedexternally, including the effect of surface heat-transfer layer .the concepts and procedures are illustrated on a simpleexample .  the relation is pointed out between the reciprocityproperty and the generalization of castigliano's principle tothermomechanics .
