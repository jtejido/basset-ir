the relation between wall temperature and the effectof roughness on boundary layer transition ..Apotter,j.l. and whitfield,j.d..Bj. ae. scs. 28, 1961, 663..Wthe relation between wall temperature and the effectof roughness on boundary layer transition .the experimentally demonstrated rise and subsequentfall of transition reynolds number with decreasing wall-to-ambient temperature ratio has been the subject of two recentnotes .  in both cases it was argued that the increasedeffectiveness of roughness due to wall cooling was not sufficient toexplain the transition-reversal phenomenon on nominally smoothbodies .  in one case, the criterion for transition reversal wastaken to be and in the other values of as low aseter is a reynolds number formed from velocity andkinematic viscosity based on calculated conditions at the height ofroughness element k in the undisturbed, laminar boundary layerat the station of roughness location .  the present note issubmitted to show that another method for evaluating the effectof roughness on transition leads to an opposite conclusion .
