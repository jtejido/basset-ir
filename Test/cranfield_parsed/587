variational analysis of ablation ..Am. a. biot and h. daughaday.Bconsultant and principal research engineer, respectively, cornellaeronautical laboratory, inc., buffalo 21, n.y..Wvariational analysis of ablation .the variational and lagrangian thermodynamics developed in earlierpublications are directly applicable to problems of heat conductionwith melting boundaries .  these techniques are used here in treatingthe problem of a half-space subjected to a constant rate of heat inputat the melting surface (fig. 1) .the applicability of the lagrangian equations to this case followsfrom the fact that the basic variational principle is valid whether theboundaries are fixed or move as arbitrary functions of time .  thiscan be seen if we remember that the equations govern only theinstantaneous configuration of the flow rates for a given geometry andtemperature field .
