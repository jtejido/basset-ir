the wake behind an oscillating vehicle ..Azeisberg,s.l..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 1344..Wthe wake behind an oscillating vehicle .  the incompressible laminar far wake behind an oscillatingvehicle is analyzed with the use of the oseen linearization, andthe assumption that the wake cross section is axisymmetric .time-wise drag variations are thus represented as changes in thewake diameter and velocity defect .  it is shown that theunsteadiness in this flow can be predicted by a quasi-steady theory .
