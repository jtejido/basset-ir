theoretical considerations of flutter at high machnumber ..Amorgan,h.g., runyam,h.l. and huckell,v..Bj. ae. scs. 25, 1958..Wtheoretical considerations of flutter at high machnumber .  some of the theories for two-dimensional oscillatory air forceswhich may be applied in flutter calculations at high machnumbers are discussed .  these include linear theory, van dyke'ssecond-order theory, piston theory, landahl's method,tangent-wedge and tangent-cone approximations, newtonian theory, anda new nonlinear-pressure method .  a comparison of the theoriesis made by showing the results of flutter calculations for machnumbers up to 10, and the possibility of flutter at these highermach numbers is pointed out .  results of flutter calculations are shown to illustrate thevarious effects arising from a nonlinear thickness theory .  thepossibility of large flutter speed thickness effects which depend onfrequency ratio is shown .  the influence of airfoil shape is discussedand flutter speed trends with center of gravity and elastic axislocations are presented .  some possible refinements of pistontheory are discussed for use at very high mach numbers .  theseinclude the use of local flow conditions and the use of newtoniantheory over the leading edge of a blunt-nosed airfoil .
