pressure distribution on two dimensional wings nearthe ground ..Abagley,j.a..Brae r. aero.2625, 1960..Wpressure distribution on two dimensional wings nearthe ground .  a simple method of calculatingthe pressure distribution inincompressible flow on two-dimensional aerofoilsof arbitrary section at moderatedistances from the ground is developed .comparisons with an /exact/ potentialflow solution, and with measurementson a 10 thick aerofoil of rae.101section, provide a satisfactoryverification of the adequacy of the method ,.but it is shown that it is necessaryto take account of the boundary layeron the aerofoil in the calculations .
