on the numerical calculation of detached bow shockwaves in hypersonic flow ..Agarabedian,p.r. and liebersten,h.m..Bj. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 109..Won the numerical calculation of detached bow shockwaves in hypersonic flow .  a method is described for calculating examples of hypersonicflow with a detached bow shock wave past a bluff axiallysymmetric body .  the form of the shock wave is assumed, and theanalysis is based on a cauchy problem for the stream functionin the subsonic region, where the motion is governed by apartial differential equation of elliptic type .  through analyticcontinuation into the complex domain, the cauchy problem isreformulated in such a manner that it becomes properly set in thesubsonic region .  this leads to a stable scheme for computationof the flow by finite differences .  numerical examples atfreestream mach number 5.8 are presented in which the flow isdetermined throughout the subsonic region, and, in particular, thedetachment distance, the location of the sonic line, and thepressure distribution along the body are calculated .  these results arein excellent agreement with experimental data obtained at thecalifornia institute of technology .
