liapunov's methods in automatic control theory ..Aparks, p. c..Bcontrol, november and december 1962 ..Wliapunov's methods in automatic control theory .the work of a. m. liapunov and his theory of stability is discussed .the second method of liapunov is shown to have applications for linearequations with real constant coefficients, for a proof of therouth-hurwitz criterion, and linear equations with periodic coefficients .practical examples include non-linear stability problems of control, and the functions have uses in other areas of control systems .
