the supersonic blunt body problem - review and extensions ..Avan dyke,m.d..Bj. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 485..Wthe supersonic blunt body problem - review and extensions .  a survey of existing analytical treatments of the supersonic orhypersonic blunt-body problem indicates that none is adequatefor predicting the details of the flow field .  reasons are given forthe failure of various plausible approximations .  a numericalmethod, which is simpler than others proposed, is set forth forsolving the full inviscid equations using a medium-sized electroniccomputer .  results are shown from a number of solutions forbodies that support detached shock waves described by conicsections .
