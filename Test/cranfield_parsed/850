remarks on donnell's equations ..Akempner,j..Bj. app. mech. 22, 1955..Wremarks on donnell's equations .  flugge's set of differential equations of equilibrium forcircular cylindrical shells is expressed in a form analogousto the donnell equations .  the results of solutions of thetwo sets of equations for a simply supported cylinder undera centrally applied, uniformly distributed radial line loadover a generator segment, as well as under sinusoidallyapplied line loads, are in very good agreement for theparticular geometry investigated .
