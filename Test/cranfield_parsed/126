an investigation of two-dimensional supersonic basepressures ..Acharwat,a.f. and yakura,j.k..Bj.aero.scs. 25, 1958, 122..Wan investigation of two-dimensional supersonic basepressures .  an investigation of the base pressure behind wedges at machnumbers 2 and 3 in the laminar and the transitional regime isreported .  temperature and velocity traverses through themixing zone are shown and exploratory investigations of thewake vortex by use of hot wires and flow-visualization techniquesare described .  it is found that the laminar two-dimensional basepressure agrees well with chapman's theoretical predictions .the shear layer exhibits gross velocity distributionscharacteristic of the free jet mixing zone, but also shows disturbances thatoriginate in the expansion-turning of the oncoming boundarylayer .  an interesting trailing vortex is observed, which isexplained in terms of nonuniform mixing rate in the wake .
