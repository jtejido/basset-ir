unsteady oblique interaction of a shock wave with planedisturbances ..Amoore,f.k..Bnaca tn.2879, 1953..Wunsteady oblique interaction of a shock wave with planedisturbances .  analysis is made of the flow field produced by oblique impingementof weak plane disturbances of arbitraryprofile on a plane normal shock .three types of disturbance are considered ..moves .  the sound wave refracts eitheras a simple isentropic sound waveor as an attenuating isentropic pressure wave, depending on the anglebetween the shock and the incidentsound wave .  a stationary vorticitywave of constant pressure appears behind the shock .reflects as a sound wave, and a stationary vorticity wave is produced .the shock .  the incident wave refracts as a stationary vorticity wave,and either a sound wave or attenuating pressure wave is also produced .  computations are presented for the first two types of incident wave,over the range of incidence angles, for shock mach numbers of 1, 1.5,and .
