similarity laws for aerothermoelastic testing ..Adugundji,j..Bj.ae.scs. 29, 1962, 935..Wsimilarity laws for aerothermoelastic testing .  the similarity laws for aerothermoelastic testing are presentedin the range .  these are obtained bymaking nondimensional the appropriate governing equations ofthe individual external aerodynamic flow, heat conduction tothe interior, and stress-deflection problems which make up thecombined aerothermoelastic problem .  for the general aerothermoelastic model, where the model isplaced in a high-stagnation-temperature wind tunnel, similitudeis shown to be very difficult to achieve for a scale ratio otherthan unity .  the primary conflict occurs between thefree-stream mach number reynolds number aeroelasticparameter heat conduction parameter andthermal expansion parameter .  means of dealing with this basic conflict are presented .  theseinclude (1) looking at more specialized situations, such as thebehavior of wing structures and of thin solid plate lifting surfaces,and panel flutter, where the aerothermoelastic similarityparameters assume less restrictive forms, (2) the use of /incompleteaerothermoelastic/ testing in which the pressure and/or heatingrates are estimated in advance and applied artificially to themodel, and (3) the use of /restricted purpose/ modelsinvestigating separately one or another facet of the completeaerothermoelastic problem .  some numerical examples of modeling for the generalaerothermoelastic case as well as for the specialized situationsmentioned in (1) above are given .  finally, extension of the aerothermoelastic similarity laws tohigher speeds and temperatures is discussed .
