free vibrations of continuous skin stringer panels ..Alin, y.k..Bj. appl. mech. december 1960 ..Wfree vibrations of continuous skin stringer panels .the determination of the natural frequencies and normal modes ofvibration for continuous panels, representing more or less typical fuselageskin-panel construction for modern airplanes, is discussed in this paperare considered . a numerical example is presented, and analyticalresults for a particular structural configuration agree favorably withavailable experimental measurements .
