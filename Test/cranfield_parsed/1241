the turbulent boundary layer on chemically active ablatingsurfaces ..Adenison,m.r..Bj. ae. scs. 1961..Wthe turbulent boundary layer on chemically active ablatingsurfaces .  incompressible turbulent-boundary-layer analysis isextrapolated analytically to the case of a compressible turbulentboundary layer with ablation or mass injection at the surface .the effects of chemical reactions such as dissociation andrecombination as well as combustion are included .  the analysisapplies to blunt as well as sharp bodies which are eitheraxisymmetric or two-dimensional .  when the turbulent lewis andprandtl numbers are unity, it is found that, as in the laminarcase, little detailed knowledge of the chemistry inside theboundary layer is required in most instances .  the conditions at thesurface and the outer edge of the boundary layer are oftensufficient for prediction of heat and mass transfer .  comparison is made with experiments on the combustion ofgraphite under turbulent flow conditions .  prediction of ablationrates within about 30 percent accuracy is obtained whenempirical constants obtained from incompressible velocity profileswith no mass injection are used .
