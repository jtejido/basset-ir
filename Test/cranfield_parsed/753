development of a quasi-steady approach to flutter andcorrelation with kernel-function results ..Agravitz,s.i., laidlaw,w.r., bryce,w.w. and cooper,r.e..Bj.ae.scs. 29, 1962, 445..Wdevelopment of a quasi-steady approach to flutter andcorrelation with kernel-function results .  the quasi-steady approach to flutter utilizes experimental ortheoretical steady-state aerodynamic data to arrive at increasedunderstanding of the flutter mechanism, and also, in many cases,acceptably accurate quantitative flutter predictions .circulation lag effects are neglected, but aerodynamic damping isincluded in the evaluation of the air forces .  situations requiringthe inclusion of rate aerodynamics for accurate flutter estimationare specified .  a quasi-unsteady approach is also discussed, in which theapproximate magnitude of the circulation lag function at flutteris included in simple modifications of quasi-steady parameters .  closed-form solutions are derived for the flutter characteristicsof a typical section with and without rate aerodynamics .application is then made to the rational flutter analysis ofthree-dimensional multi-degree-of-freedom lifting surfaces .  a specific planform is evaluated in the mach-number rangefrom zero to two .  quasi-steady, quasi-unsteady, andkernel-function results are compared subsonically .  quasi-steadyresults are utilized supersonically .  primary applications of the quasi-steady approach are in theareas of preliminary design and parameter-variation studies,modification of more sophisticated flutter theories to forcecompatibility with available steady-state data, and flutter evaluationof complex configurations which can be rationally analyzed bysteady-state aerodynamic theories, but for which no completeunsteady aerodynamic theories are presently available .
