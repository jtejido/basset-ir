on alternative forms for the basic equations of transonicflow theory ..Aspreiter,j.r..Bj. ae. scs. 21, 1954..Won alternative forms for the basic equations of transonicflow theory .attention has been called by numerous authors to thepossibility of certain alternative forms for the equations fortransonic flow about thin wings .  it is the purpose of this noteto contribute to this discussion and to indicate some reasons forthe selection of one form of these in preference to another morewidely used form .
