plasma flow over a thin charged conductor ..Ayoshihara,h..Bj. ae. scs. 1961, 141..Wplasma flow over a thin charged conductor .  the flow of a dense plasma over a wavy conducting wall ofsmall amplitude is investigated where magnetic effects arenegligible .  these results are then used to analyze the flow overa thin conductor with cusped edges .  it is found that thecoulomb drag vanishes identically, while the fluid-pressure dragcorresponds to the ackeret value for a neutral particle gas at thereduced-plasma mach number .
