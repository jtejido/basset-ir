steady flow of conducting fluids in channels undertransverse magnetic fields, with consideration of halleffect ..Atani,i..Bj. ae. scs.1962, 297..Wsteady flow of conducting fluids in channels undertransverse magnetic fields, with consideration of halleffect .  an approximate method of solution based on a minimumprinciple is presented for the steady laminar incompressible flow of anelectrically conducting fluid through a straight channel ofarbitrary cross section with conducting or nonconducting walls in thepresence of a uniform transverse magnetic field .  the hall effectis taken into account by making simplifying assumptions that thegas is fully ionized and that both reynolds number and magneticreynolds number are small .  numerical calculations are carriedout for the case of a rectangular channel .
