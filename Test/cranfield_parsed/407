stationary convection flow of an electrically conductingliquid between parallel plates in a magnetic field ..Agershuni,g.z. and shukhovitskii,e.m..Bsoviet physics,34, 1958..Wstationary convection flow of an electrically conductingliquid between parallel plates in a magnetic field .  a study is made of the stationary convectionof an electrically conducting liquid in the spacebetween two parallel plates, heated to differenttemperatures, in the presence of a magneticfield .  the distribution of velocity, temperature,and induced fields are found, and the convectiveheat flow is calculated .
