note on creep buckling of columns ..A.B.Wnote on creep buckling of columns .  the phenomenological theory previouslyproposed in naca technicalnote 4000 for the behavior of metals atelevated temperatures has beenmodified to yield transient creep curvesby assuming that the metalconsists of two phases, each with its ownelasticity and viscosity .  theextended theory satisfies the basicrequirements for a theory oftransient creep at elevated temperatures ..that the transient creep be closelyconnected with the subsequent steadycreep, and that the apparentexponent of the time in the transient regionbe permitted wide variationsbetween 0 and 1 .  from this theory it ispossible to constructnondimensional creep curves which extend continuouslyfrom the transient regioninto the steady-state region .  thecorresponding family of creep curvesfor any metal may be obtained fromthe nondimensional family by use ofappropriate constants .  the constantsrequired are those obtained fromsteady creep measurements, togetherwith two additional constants whichrepresent the difference between thephases .  the transient creep curvesresulting from this theory are comparedwith the experimental curvesfor pure aluminum, gamma iron, lead, andagreement is found .
