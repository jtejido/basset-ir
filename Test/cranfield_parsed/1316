temperature measurements of shock-waves by spectrum-line reversal, ii adouble beam method ..Aclouston, j.g., gaydon, a.g. and hurle, i.r.Bproc. roy. soc. a252, p143, september 1959 ..Wtemperature measurements of shock-waves by spectrum-line reversal, ii adouble beam method .the sodium-line reversal method, as previously described, using aphotomultiplier and oscillograph, has been modified . two light beamsare now employed, and interference filters are used in front of thephotomultipliers instead of a spectrograph . in one beam the backgroundsource is viewed directly, through the shock tube, and in the other beam the background source is viewed through the shock tube by a mirrorsystem with a neutral filter interposed to reduce its effectivebrightness temperature . with a suitably chosen temperature for thebackground, one oscillograph trace indicates absorption and the otherindicates emission of the sodium lines . it is thus possible, from therecords of a single shock, to determine the temperature history behindthe shock wave to about 20degreec . nitrogen and oxygen again showrelaxation effects near the front . temperatures in argon tend to comelow, owing to radiative disequilibrium,. excitation processes in argonare discussed . with this system it is possible to determinetemperatures rather higher than that of the background source . some work hasalso been done, with a single-beam method, using a carbon arc asbackground and following reversal of the indium blue line . temperatures up to 3600degreek have been measured in shocks through nitrogen, butthe time resolution is not so good .
