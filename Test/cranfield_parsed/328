the boundary layer near the stagnation point in hypersonicflow past a sphere ..Aherring,t.r..Bj. fluid mech. 7, 1960, 257..Wthe boundary layer near the stagnation point in hypersonicflow past a sphere .  flow properties behind shock waves caused by bluff bodiestraveling at supersonic speeds are of major importance in missileand high-speed aircraft design .  paper presents a mathematicalsolution for the laminar boundary layer near the stagnation point of asphere .  surface temperature is free-stream static and shock isstrong .  air is assumed calorically and thermally perfect with aprandtl number of 0.72 and a dynamic viscosity directlyproportional to temperature .  based on work of homann (zamm 16, p. 153, 1936) and lighthillsimultaneous differential equations for the velocity andtemperature profiles .  these are solved by numerical integration along anormal to the surface using a digital computer .  results arepresented as functions of free-stream mach number, reynoldsnumber, and specific heat ratio .  as increases,boundary-layer thickness is shown to decrease while shock stand-offdistance increases .  stand-off distance also decreases with increasingand decreasing specific heat .  for constant and specificheat ratio, the product of skin-friction coefficient and the squareroot of decreases with increasing only approaching aconstant value at greater than 10,000 .  reviewer's comment is concerned with the perfect gasassumption for air .  author suggests that the effects of dissociation onflow properties are accounted for by a proper choice of specificheat ratio .  a consideration of the kinetics of chemical reaction inthe cooled boundary layer emphasizes the oversimplification ofthis approach .  the effect on transport properties could have beenapproximated in present analysis by changing the prandtl numberto one more representative of the existing pressures andtemperatures .
