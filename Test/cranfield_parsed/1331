calculated responses of a large sweptwing airplaneto continuous turbulence with flight-test comparisons ..Abennett,f.v. and pratt,k.g..Bnasa tr r.69, 1960..Wcalculated responses of a large sweptwing airplaneto continuous turbulence with flight-test comparisons .  calculated responses of symmetricalairplane motions, wingdeformations, and wing loads due to gusts areshown to compare favorably withavailable flight-test results .  thesecalculated responses are based onrandom-process theory, five degrees offreedom, lifting-surfaceaerodynamics, and one-dimensional verticalturbulence .  the extent to whichvarious degrees of freedom contributeto the responses is examined andin this connection the relative effectsof static and dynamicaeroelasticity are determined .
