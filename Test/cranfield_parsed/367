control system and analysis and design via the second method oflyapunov ..Akalman, r. e. and bertram, j. e..Btrans. asme. series d, v. 82, june 1960 ..Wcontrol system and analysis and design via the second method oflyapunov .the/second method/of lyapunov is the most general approach currently inthe theory of stability of dynamic systems . after a rigorous exposition of the fundamental concepts of this theory, applications are made to/a/stability of linear stationary, linear nonslationary, and nonlinearsystems,./b/estimation of transient behavior,./c/control-systemoptimization,./d/design of relay servos . the discussion is essentiallyself-contained, with emphasis on the thorough development of theprincipal ideas and mathematical tools . only systems governed bydifferential equations are treated here . systems governed by differenceequations are the subject of a companion paper .
