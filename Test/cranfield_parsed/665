on the theory of hypersonic gas flow with a power lawshock wave ..Asychev,v.v..Bj. app. math. mech. 24, 1960, 756..Won the theory of hypersonic gas flow with a power lawshock wave .plane and axisymmetric hypersonic gas flows are considered with shockwaves of very great intensity that have a power-law form .  on the basisof an investigation of the portions of the flow with high entropyadjoining the surface of the body (not necessarily for a shock wave of thegiven form) it is shown that the use in the flow problem of the exactsolution for the corresponding unsteady self-similar gas motion requiresa supplementary refinement of the thickness of the high entropy layer .a method is shown for introducing such a correction and constructing theshape of the body contour, on which is to be applied the pressuredistribution obtained on the basis of the theory of small disturbances .
