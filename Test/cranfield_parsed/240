a theoretical analysis of heat transfer in regions of separated flow ..Adean r. chapman.Bnaca technote 3792.Wa theoretical analysis of heat transfer in regions of separated flow .    the flow field analyzed consists of a thin, constant pressureviscous mixing layer separated from a solid surface by an enclosedregion of low-velocity air (/dead air/) . the law of conservation ofenergy is employed to relate calculated conditions within theseparated mixing layer to the rate of heat transfer at the solidsurface . this physical speed is app ied to alminar separations incompressible flow for various prandtl numbers, including considerationof the case where air is injected into the separated region  ..Aapplication to turbulent separations is made for a prandtl number of.Bunity in low-speed flow without injection .all calculations are for the case of zero boundary-layer thickness atthe position of separation .     for alminar separations the differential equations for viscous flowat arbitrary mach number are solved for the enthalpy and velocityprofiles within the thin layer where mixing with dead air takes place .results are presented in tabular form for prandtl numbers between 0.1and 10  . the rate of heat transfer to a separated laminar region in airlaminar boundary layer having the same constant pressure . injectionof gas into the separated region is calculated to have a powerful effectin reducing the rate of heat transfn  to the wall  . it is calculatedthat a moderate quantity of gas injection reduces to zero the heattransfer in a laminar separated flow .
