a simple model study of transient temperature and thermalstress distribution due to aerodynamic heating ..Aisakson,g..Bj. ae. scs. 24, 1957, 611..Wa simple model study of transient temperature and thermalstress distribution due to aerodynamic heating .  the present work is concerned with the determination oftransient temperatures and thermal stresses in simple models intendedto simulate parts or the whole of an aircraft structure of the built-up variety subjected to aerodynamic heating .  the first case considered is that of convective heat transferinto one side of a flat plate, representing a thick skin, and theeffect of the resulting temperature distribution in inducingthermal stresses associated with bending restraint at the plate edges .numerical results are presented for the transient temperaturedifferentials in the plate when the environment temperature firstincreases linearly with time and then remains constant, theperiod of linear increase representing the time of acceleration ofthe aircraft .  corresponding thermal stress information ispresented .  the second case is that of the wide-flanged i-beam withconvective heat transfer into the outer faces of the flanges .  numericalresults are presented for transient temperature differentials for awide range of values of the applicable parameters and for anenvironment temperature variation as described above .corresponding thermal stresses in a beam of infinite length aredetermined .  a theoretical analysis of the stress distribution in a beamof finite length is carried out and numerical results obtained forone case .  an experimental investigation of temperatures andstresses in such a beam is described, and results are presentedwhich indicate good agreement with corresponding theoreticalresults .
