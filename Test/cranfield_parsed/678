the effect of end plates on swept wings ..Akuchemann,d. and kettle,d.j..Brae r.aero.2429, 1952..Wthe effect of end plates on swept wings .  existing methods of calculatingthe effect of endplates on straightwings are modified so as to apply toswept wings .  the changes in overalllift and drag, and also the spanwisedistribution of the additional load,can be calculated .  the theoretical results arecompared with experimental resultsobtained on swept wings, includingnew measurements of lift, drag andpitching moment, made on an untapered  the method of calculation is alsoextended to cover the effect ofthe tip vortex which is formed on wingswithout endplates .
