a study of flow fields about some typical blunt-nosedslender bodies ..Avaglio-laurin,r. and trella,m..Bpibal r.623, 1960..Wa study of flow fields about some typical blunt-nosedslender bodies .  complete inviscid flow fields about three model axisymmetricconfigurations have been determined numerically .  configurationsdecreasing bluntness) and flight conditions have been selected soas to indicate separately effects of nose shape, drag coefficient,flight mach number, and thermodynamic behavior of the gas (eitherideal calorically perfect gas or air in equilibrium dissociation) .results are presented for thirteen cases .  particular attention isdevoted to interpretation and, when possible, correlation ofpressure distributions on, and shock shapes about, the cylindricalafterbodies .  it is found that ..  (a) the correlation of pressuredistributions on bodies having nonspherical noses involves interpretivemodifications of the law suggested by blast wave analogy .  alsoshocks about these bodies are not described by parabolae,. (b) forall configurations there is substantial influence of gas behavioron shock shape,. this, however, can be correlated in terms of thegas conditions along a generally defined streamline,. (c) the shocklayer can generally be divided into two regions (the first bound bythe body and the aforementioned streamline, the second delimitedby this streamline and the shock) wherein flow properties caneither be approximated by simple laws or correlated ..  (d) for eachconfiguration knowledge of the complete flow field in one flightcondition (even pertaining to ideal gas flow) can be used toestimate features of flows under general flight conditions includingthose where equilibrium dissociation is encountered .
