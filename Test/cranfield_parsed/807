ground measurements of the shock wave noise fromsupersonic bomber airplanes in the altitude range from 30,000to 50,000 feet ..Amaglieri,d.j. and hubbard,h.h..Bnasa tn.d880, 1961..Wground measurements of the shock wave noise fromsupersonic bomber airplanes in the altitude range from 30,000to 50,000 feet .  shock-wave ground-pressure measurementshave been made forsupersonic bomber airplanes in the mach numberrange from 1.24 to 1.52, foraltitudes from about 30,000 to 50,000 feet,and for a gross-weight rangefrom about 83,000 to 120,000 pounds .  themeasured overpressures weregenerally higher than would be predictedby the theory which accountsonly for volume effects .  there is thusa suggestion that lift effectson sonic-boom intensity may be significantfor this type of airplanefor the altitude range of the present tests .
