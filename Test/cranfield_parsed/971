surface pressure distributions with a sonic jet normal to adjacent flatsurfaces at mach 2.92 to 6.4 ..Acubbison, r.w., anderson, b.h. and ward, j.j..Bnasa tn d-580, february 1961 ..Wsurface pressure distributions with a sonic jet normal to adjacent flatsurfaces at mach 2.92 to 6.4 .an investigation was made to determine the interference effects onsurface pressure distributions caused by a sonic jet exiting normal to thesurface . two configurations, a flat plate and an arrow-wingreentry-type vehicle, with sonic nozzles near the leading edge were tested overa range of pressure ratios and reynolds numbers for mach numbers fromthe data indicate that jet pressure ratio had considerable effect on the pressure levels and distributions on both configurations . also, for aconstant jet pressure ratio, the free-stream mach number effect on thedistributions and levels was quite large . over the limited rangeinvestigated, the effect of reynolds number at constant mach number andpressure ratio was small compared to the mach number and pressure ratioeffect .
