optimum nose shapes for missiles in the super-aerodynamicregion ..Acarter,w.j..Bj. ae. scs. 24, 1957, 527..Woptimum nose shapes for missiles in the super-aerodynamicregion .  the mechanics of the kinetic theory of gases is employed todescribe the drag force on the nose of a missile moving in thesuper-aerodynamic region of the atmosphere .  three separate cases areconsidered--ideal specular reflection, specular-type reflectionfrom a slightly rough surface, and surface absorption followed byrandom emission of the striking molecules .  the calculus ofvariations is employed to obtain the differential equation of the noseshape which minimizes the drag force for each of the three cases .the resulting differential equations are then solved by a numericalprocedure .  the drag coefficients for the optimum nose shapes arelikewise determined and these are compared with the dragcoefficients given by other nose shapes .  it is further shown thatthe drag coefficients arising when specular-type reflections occurare significantly dependent on the nose shape .  when surfaceabsorption followed by random emission occurs, the dragcoefficient is not strongly dependent on either the missile nose shapeor the fineness ratio of the nose .
