thin airfoil theory based on approximate solution of the transonic flowequation ..Aspreiter, j. r. and alksne, a. y..Bnaca tn 3970, may, 1957 ..Wthin airfoil theory based on approximate solution of the transonic flowequation .the present paper describes a method for the approximate solution of the nonlinear equations of transonic small disturbance theory . althoughthe solutions are nonlinear, the analysis is sufficiently simple thatresults are obtained in closed analytic form for a large and significant class of nonlifting airfoils . application to two-dimensional flowswith free-stream mach number near 1 leads, for instance, to generalexpressions for the determination of the pressure distribution on anairfoil of specified geometry and for the shape of an airfoil having aprescribed pressure distribution and gives, furthermore, the correctvariation of pressure with mach number at mach number 1 . for flows that are subsonic everywhere, the method yields a pressure-correctionformula that is more accurate than the prandtl-glauert rule and comparesfavorably with existing higher approximations . for flows that aresupersonic everywhere, the method yields the equivalent, in transonicapproximation, of simple wave theory . results obtained by applicationof these general expressions are shown to correspond closely to existing solutions and to experimental data for a wide variety of airfoils .
