boundary layer characteristics of caret wings ..Acatherall,d..Brae tn.aero.2835, 1962..Wboundary layer characteristics of caret wings .  the theory of laminar boundarylayers along flat surfaces has beenused in conjunction with eckert'sapproximations to the displacementthickness, skin friction and temperatureprofiles on the undersurface of acaret wing configuration .  to a firstapproximation it has been assumedthat parallel flow exits behind the shockoutside the boundary layer, and thedisplacement of the shock by the boundarylayer near the leading edge is neglected .  conduction of heat within thebody and along the surface is neglectedbut radiation is included, so thatare found .  examples are given forvarious altitudes and configurations andthe effect of the skin friction onthe lift drag ratio calculated, assumingthe undersurfaces to be plane .
