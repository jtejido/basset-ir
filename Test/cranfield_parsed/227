a technique for improving the predictions of linearisedtheory on the drag of straight edge wings ..Arandall,d.g..Barc cp394, 1957..Wa technique for improving the predictions of linearisedtheory on the drag of straight edge wings .  the curve of drag against mach number for straight-edged wings,calculated by using the linearised theory of supersonic flow, displaysdiscontinuities in slope at the various mach numbers for which the edgesare sonic .  these features, which are not observed in practice, are dueto the fact that linearised theory predicts an infinite pressure alonga subsonic or sonic edge .  it is shown that if the linearised equationof supersonic flow is used to determine the flow over straight-edgedwings, but the linearised boundary condition is replaced by the fullplaced by plausible values .  on this basis a simple method is derivedfor improving the linearised predictions of the drag of straight-edgedwings which exhibits satisfactory agreement with experimental results .  while the technique is not directly applicable to ridge lines, anartifice renders them amenable to similar treatment .
