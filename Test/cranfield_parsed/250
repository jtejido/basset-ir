pressure distributions at zero lift for delta wingswith rhombic cross sections ..Aeminton,e..Barc cp.525, 1960..Wpressure distributions at zero lift for delta wingswith rhombic cross sections .  the linearised theory of thin wings is used to calculate pressuredistributions over delta wings with rhombic cross sections .  a deuceprogramme has been written for the calculation and some of the resultsare compared with those of slender thin wing theory .
