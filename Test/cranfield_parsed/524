stagnation point heat transfer in partially ionizedair ..Arozycki,r.c. and fenster,s.j..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962..Wstagnation point heat transfer in partially ionizedair .  comparison of heat-transfer rates, obtained by using transportproperties recently reported by peng and pindroh, with rates basedon hansen's thermodynamic and transport properties .  it is shownthat the heat-transfer rates based on the peng and pindroh dataare 20 to 30 lower for the velocity range of 25,000 to 40,000ft sec .
