investigation with an interferometer of the turbulentmixing of a free supersonic jet ..Agooderum,p.b., wood,g.p. and brevoort,m..Bnaca r963, 1950..Winvestigation with an interferometer of the turbulentmixing of a free supersonic jet .  the free turbulent mixing of a supersonic jet of mach numberof which a description is given, was used for the investigation .density and velocity distributions through the mixing zonehave been obtained .  it was found that there was similarityin distribution at the cross sections investigated and that, inthe subsonic portion of the mixing zone, the velocitydistribution fitted the theoretical distribution for incompressible flow .it was found that the rates of spread of the mixing zone bothinto the jet and into the ambient air were less than those ofsubsonic jets .
