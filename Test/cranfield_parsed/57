applicability of the hypersonic similarity rule topressure distributions which include the effects ofrotation for bodies of revolution at zero angle ofattack ..Arossow,v.j..Bnaca tn.2399, 1951..Wapplicability of the hypersonic similarity rule topressure distributions which include the effects ofrotation for bodies of revolution at zero angle ofattack .  the analysis of technical note 2250, 1950, is extended to includethe effects of flow rotation .  it isfound that the theoretical pressuredistributions over ogive cylinders can be related by the hypersonicsimilarity rule with sufficient accuracy for most engineering purposes .  the error introduced into pressure distributions and drag of ogivecylinders by ignoring the rotation term in the characteristic equationsis investigated .  it is found thatthe influence of the rotation term onpressure distribution and drag depends only upon the similarityparameter k (mach number divided by fineness ratio) .although the error indrag, due to neglect of the rotation term, is negligible at k=0.5, theerror is about 30 percent at k=2.0 .  charts are presented for the rapid determination of pressuredistributions for rotational flow overogive cylinders for all values ofthe similarity parameter between 0.5 andof mach number and fineness ratio .
