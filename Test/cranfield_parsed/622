scale height in the upper atmosphere, derived from changes in satelliteorbits ..Aking-hele, d.g. and hughes, k.m..Br.a.e. tn space 4, 1962 ..Wscale height in the upper atmosphere, derived from changes in satelliteorbits .the'density scale height'h in the upper atmosphere is a measure of therate at which air density p varies with height y, being given byh-p//dp/dy/ . the value of h, although important because/with themolecular weight of the air/it determines the air temperature, has notas yet been well determined at heights above 200 km .this note develops methods for finding h from the decrease in asatellite's perigee height and from the decrease in the orbital periodof a satellite in a small-eccentricity orbit . these methods are thenapplied to all the 14 satellites found suitable for the purpose . the 44 values of h obtained, for heights of 200-450 km, represent an averageover day and night and probably have errors/s.d./of 5-10( . it is foundthat, as solar activity declined between 1957 and 1961, h decreasedgreatly ..e.g.at height 275 km, h decreased from 60 km in early 1958 toheight becomes much less rapid above 350 km, and are consistent with the supposition that h had low values, near 35 km, at heights near 250 km,for 1959-61 . the results could be greatly extended in scope andimproved in accuracy if more accurate orbits were available forshort-lifetime satellites .
