effects of simulated rocket jet exhaust on stabilityand control of a research type airplane configurationat a mach number of 6. 86 ..Afetterman,d.e..Bnasa tm.x127, 1959..Weffects of simulated rocket jet exhaust on stabilityand control of a research type airplane configurationat a mach number of 6. 86 .  an investigation has beenundertaken in the langley 11-inchhypersonic tunnel at a free-streammach number of 6.86 to determinethe jet-interference effects athigh jet-static-pressure ratios on thestability and control of aresearch-type airplane configuration .compressed-air tests with a jetexhausting from the base of thefuselage were conducted over a reynoldsnumber range of 0.57 x 10 toand over a jet-static-pressure-ratio range of 0 to 1460 .  the resultsof these tests indicated thatthe operation of the jet induced asizable separated-flow region overthe vertical- and horizontal-tailsurfaces which could be approximatelyduplicated at low angles of attackby use of metal jet-boundarysimulators .  the results of force tests,during which these metaljet-boundary simulators were used,indicated that this separated-flowregion caused a large reduction inthe longitudinal stability andcontrol and a smaller reduction in thelateral and directional stabilityand control .  by extending thedivergent section of the nozzle and thusreducing the jet-static-pressureratio, these losses were diminished .
