integration of the boundary layer equations for a plane in compressibleflow with heat transfer ..Ameksyn, d..Bproc. roy. soc. series a. v. 231, 1955. pp 274-180 ..Wintegration of the boundary layer equations for a plane in compressibleflow with heat transfer .the equations of motion of compressible viscous flow with vanishingpressure gradient past a plane are integrated in semi-convergentexpressions, for the case when the physical constants depend ontemperature and the prandtl number is close to unity .simple expressions are obtained for the temperature and velocitydistributions in the boundary layer, the drag coefficient, and theirdependence on the physical constants,.they contain the well-known resultsand several new ones .for the case when the temperature of the boundary is either above, ornot much below, the temperature of the main flow, the results obtainedclosely agree with crocco's numerical computations .
