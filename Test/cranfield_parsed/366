helium injection into the boundary layer at an axisymmetricstagnation point ..Afox,h. and libby,p.a..Bj. ae. scs. 1962, 921..Whelium injection into the boundary layer at an axisymmetricstagnation point .  this report presents a theoretical analysis of the boundarylayer at an axisymmetric stagnation point with large rates ofhelium injection .  the exact stagnation-point boundary-layerequations are integrated numerically with approximaterepresentations of the gas properties .  the treatment of thetwo-point boundary-value problem employed herein is shown to beuseful for various boundary-layer and mixing problems .  theexact solutions indicate that for large rates of injection theboundary layer can be represented by a thick, inner layer ofconstant shear, temperature, and composition and by a relativelythin outer region in which the flow variables adjust to theirfree-stream values .  an inviscid-flow model is shown to lead toaccurate predictions of this shear layer and will thus providesufficiently accurate profiles for use in the study of the downstreaminfluence of stagnation-point mass transfer .  the heat transferto the stagnation point is also considered .  tabulations of theeigenvalues for a variety of wall conditions and injection ratesare given .
