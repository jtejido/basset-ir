calculated subsonic span loads and resulting stability derivatives ofunswept and 45degree sweptback tail surfaces in sideslip and steady roll ..Aqueiijo, m.j. and riley, d.r..Bnaca, tn 3245, 1954 ..Wcalculated subsonic span loads and resulting stability derivatives ofunswept and 45degree sweptback tail surfaces in sideslip and steady roll .subsonic span loads and the resulting stability derivatives have beencalculated for a systematic series of vertical- and horizontal-tailcombinations in sideslip and in steady roll in order to provideinformation embracing a wide range of probable tail configurations . all calculations were made by application of the discrete-horseshoe-vortexmethod to the problem of estimating loads on intersecting surfaces . the investigation covered variations in vertical-tail aspect ratio, theratio of horizontal-tail aspect ratio to vertical-tail aspect ratio, the effects of horizontal-tail dihedral angle /for the sideslip case/, andthe effects of vertical position of the horizontal tail for surfaceshaving their quarter-chord lines swept back 0degrees and 45degrees . the results of the investigation are presented in charts from which thespan loads for the various conditions can be obtained . the resultingstability derivatives are presented as vertical- and horizontal-tailcontributions as well as total-tail-assembly derivatives .the results of this investigation, which was made for a wider range ofgeometric variables than previous studies, showed trends which were ingeneral agreement with the results of previous investigations . alsopresented in this paper and used in the computations is an extensivetable of values of sidewash due to a rectangular vortex .
