the asymptotic boundary layer on a circular cylinderin axial incompressible flow ..Astewartson,k..Bq.app.math. 13, 1955, 113..Wthe asymptotic boundary layer on a circular cylinderin axial incompressible flow .  in this paper the incompressible boundary layer over acircular cylinder in an axial flow is investigated far from theleading edge .  if u and v are the velocity components in thex and r direction respectively and a stream function isintroduced by and, thenfor a constant free-stream velocity has thefollowing asymptotic form ..where the p's are determined successively, first for s=1 andall t, then s=2 and all t, etc., from ordinary differentialequations .  here and log c=euler'sconstant .  it is shown that the effect of the curvature of thebody (in planes perpendicular to the flow) is to increasethe skin friction .  also the case in which the free-streamvelocity is proportional to (at themethod breaks down), is studied .  it is concluded that theeffect of the curvature of the cylinder, when the boundarylayer has a thickness comparable with its radius ofcurvature, is to delay separation .
