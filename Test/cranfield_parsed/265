some instabilities arising from the interaction betweenshock waves and boundary layer ..Alambourne,n.c..Bnpl aero.348, 1958..Wsome instabilities arising from the interaction betweenshock waves and boundary layer .  a brief review is made of the available information concerningthe flow fluctuations and instabilities arising from shock-inducedseparation in the flow over aerofoils and wings .  the influence thisphenomenon has on the oscillatory behaviour of aerofoils and controlsurfaces is also briefly discussed .  a more detailed consideration is devoted to a recent investigationat the n.p.l. into the part played by shock-induced separation in theinstability of a control surface .
