free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic ..A.B.Wfree-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .  the real-gas hypersonic flow parameters for helium have beencalculated for stagnation temperatures from 0 f to 600 f and stagnationpressures up to 6,000 pounds per square inch absolute .  the results ofthese calculations are presented in the form of simple correctionfactors which must be applied to the tabulated ideal-gas parameters .  ithas been shown that the deviations from the ideal-gas law which existat high pressures may cause a corresponding significant error in thehypersonic flow parameters when calculated as an ideal gas .  forexample, the ratio of the free-stream static to stagnation pressure ascalculated from the thermodynamic properties of helium for a stagnationtemperature of 80 f and pressure of 4,000 pounds per square inchabsolute was found to be approximately 13 percent greater than thatdetermined from the ideal-gas tabulation with a specific heat ratio of
