experiments on supersonic blunt-body flows ..Akendall,j.m..Bj.p.l.prog. r.20-372, 1959..Wexperiments on supersonic blunt-body flows .  recently, progress has been made in the theoretical calculation ofthe inviscid flow between the detached shock wave and the surface ofa blunt body travelling at supersonic speed .  detailed experimentaldata are needed for comparison .  experiments have been made in thesupersonic wind tunnels of the jet propulsion laboratory on spheres,disks, and blunted cones over the mach number range 1.8 to 5.0 in air .surface pressures, shock wave shape and detachment distance, certainvelocity gradients, the sonic line location, and some streamline pathswere determined .  the sonic line is found as the trace of thetermination point of a weak shock generated by a probe ahead of the model .for a sphere, good agreement between theory (of van dyke) and experimentis found .
