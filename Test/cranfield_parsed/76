flight measurement of wall pressure fluctuations andboundary-layer turbulence ..Amull,h.r. and algranti,j.s..Bnasa tn.d280, 1960..Wflight measurement of wall pressure fluctuations andboundary-layer turbulence .  the results are presented for a flight test program using a fightertype jet aircraft flying at pressure altitudes of 10,000, 20,000, andapparatus was used to measure and record the output of microphones andhot-wire anemometers mounted on the forward-fuselage section and wing ofthe airplane .  mean-velocity profiles in the boundary layers wereobtained from total-pressure measurements .  the ratio of the root-mean-square fluctuating wall pressure to thefree-stream dynamic pressure is presented as a function of reynoldsnumber and mach number .  the longitudinalcomponent of the turbulent-velocityfluctuations was measured, and the turbulence-intensity profiles arepresented for the wing and forward-fuselage section .  in general, the results are in agreement with wind-tunnelmeasurements which have been reported in the literature .  for example, thevariation of (is the root mean square of the wall-pressurefluctuation, and q is the free-stream dynamic pressure) with reynoldsnumber was found to be essentially constant for the forwardfuselage-section boundary layer, while variations at the wing station wereprobably unduly affected by the microphone diameter, which waslarge compared with the boundary-layer thickness .
