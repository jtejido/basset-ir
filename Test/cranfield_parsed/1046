the bending strength of pressurized cylinders ..A.B.Wthe bending strength of pressurized cylinders .  a theoretical solution is givenfor the critical stress ofthin-walled cylinders loaded in torsion .the results are presentedin terms of a few simple formulas andcurves which are applicableto a wide range of cylinder dimensionsfrom very short cylinders oflarge radius to long cylinders of smallradius .  theoreticalresults are found to be in somewhat betteragreement withexperimental results than previous theoreticalwork for the same rangeof cylinder dimensions .
