energy expressions and differential equations for stressand displacement analysis of arbitrary cylindricalshells ..Akempner,j..Bj. ship res. 1958, 8..Wenergy expressions and differential equations for stressand displacement analysis of arbitrary cylindricalshells .energy expressions and the related equilibrium equations and naturalboundary conditions for the determination of the stresses in anddisplacements of uniform, thin-walled cylinders of arbitrary cross sectionloaded in an arbitrary manner by surface and edge forces and moments arepresented .  the derivations are based upon the kirchhoff-loveassumptions of the classical theory of shells and are performed towithin a degree of accuracy employed by flugge in his derivation of theequilibrium equations applicable to circular cylindrical shells,. hence,in terms of stress resultants, the exact, small-deflection equilibriumequations are obtained .  methods of simplification of the relationsderived and of solution of the differential equations presented areindicated .
