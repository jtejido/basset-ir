on the fatigue failure of structures due to vibrations excitedby random pressure fields ..Aalan powell.Bthe university, southampton.Won the fatigue failure of structures due to vibrations excitedby random pressure fields .on the assumption that the forced modes of vibration of a structure,subjected to pressure fluctuations random in time and space, can beapproximated by the composition of the motions of the uncouplednatural modes, a general analysis is made using the ideas of vibrationtheory and spectrum analysis .  the power spectrum, and hence therms value, of any quantity depending linearly upon structuraldistortions is derived and it involves a quantity (called the /jointacceptance/) concerning the spacewise structure of the pressurefield and of the geometry of the modes of vibration .  it is shown howthis result may be used (on assuming /normal/ randomness) to estimatethe fatigue life on the hypothesis of cumulative damage .
