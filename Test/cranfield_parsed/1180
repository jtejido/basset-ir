approximate analysis of the slot injection of a gasin laminar flow ..Alibby,p.a. and schetz,j.a..Baiaa jnl. 1963, 1056..Wapproximate analysis of the slot injection of a gasin laminar flow .  the laminar diffusion and combustion of a gasinjected into a high-speed uniform stream bymeans of a wall slot are considered .  thedorodnitzin-howarth transformation is employed toreduce the boundary layer equations toincompressible form,. the nonsimilar flow field istreated by a modified oseen approximation inconjunction with the integral method .  thermalboundary conditions corresponding to an adiabaticwall and to constant wall enthalpy arediscussed .  the injection of homogeneous, heterogeneous,nonreactive, and reactive gases istreated .  for the latter case, the models usuallyemployed for chemical behavior, namely,frozen and equilibrium flow, are considered .  theanalysis is applicable to a wide variety oflaminar flows, e.g., those involving cooling, thermalprotection, skin-friction reduction, andsupersonic deflagration .  a numerical example ofpractical interest in connection with theventing of gaseous hydrogen boiloff from a rocketbooster is presented .
