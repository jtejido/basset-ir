studies on two dimensional flows of compressible fluid..A.B.Wstudies on two dimensional flows of compressible fluid.  it is well-known that when the flow is everywhere subsonic in a fieldof flow, the nature of the two-dimensional isentropic flow of acompressible perfect fluid differs only slightly from that of thecorresponding flow of an incompressible perfect fluid .  thus, in such acase, we can calculate the field of flow by any of the well-knownmethods of approximation .  on the other hand, if the flow is supersonicthroughout the field, we can determine the flow pattern by the method ofcharacteristics .
