an electronic apparatus for automatic recording ofthe logarithmic decrement and frequency for oscillationsin the audio and subaudio frequency range ..Aolsson,c.o. and orlik-ruckeman,k..Baero. res. inst. sweden, r.52, 1954..Wan electronic apparatus for automatic recording ofthe logarithmic decrement and frequency for oscillationsin the audio and subaudio frequency range .  an electronic apparatus for automaticevaluation of the damping of a harmonicoscillation has been designed and constructed .the apparatus is based on the ideaof representing the harmonic dampedoscillation by a rotating vector on the screenof a cathode-ray tube in such a way, thatthe rate of decrease of the length of thevector is a measure of the damping .  theresults are obtained simultaneously withthe oscillation test as two numbers indecimal digits, which are inverselyproportional to the logarithmic decrement andthe frequency, respectively .  theapparatus, which is named the /dampometer/,has been used for some time for freeoscillation measurements of the dynamicstability derivatives of aeroplane modelsin windtunnels, and has proved to be verysatisfactory .  it gives results of usuallyhigher accuracy than evaluation methods incommon use, and permits a most considerablesaving of time .
