approximate determination of position of the sonicline for a blunt body in hypersonic flow ..Arahman,m.a..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962..Wapproximate determination of position of the sonicline for a blunt body in hypersonic flow .the detached shock in front of a blunt body in hypersonicflow tends to acquire the shape of the frontal curvature of thebody .  thus the curvature of the shock can be assumed to be thesame as that of the body, at least up to the sonic point (point a,fig. 1) .  if the equation of curvature of the body is known, theequation of curvature of the shock is also known .  in this paper,with this assumption, a method is described to determine theapproximate position of the sonic line (ao'b, fig. 1) .  theshock-detachment distance is assumed known .  the method is, of course, general .  this can be applied toany detached shock provided its equation of curvature is knowncorresponding to that of the body .  for simplicity the detachedshock is assumed to be circular in this paper and the procedure isoutlined below with the assumption that the sonic line ao'b isparabolic .
