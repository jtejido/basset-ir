on magnetohydrodynamic shock waves ..Akanwal,r..Bj.math.mech. 9, 1960, 681..Won magnetohydrodynamic shock waves .  in the earlier attempts at finding the jump conditionsacross a hydromagnetic shock wave (1, 2, 3)various simplifying assumptionsregarding the shape of the shock and thedimensions and the character of themotion are made .  from that analysis itis possible to write down the jumpconditions in a higher degree of generality (4) .  the shock conditions for magnetohydrodynamicflows can, however, bederived in their full generality with the helpof the transport equation as used bythomas (5) in the derivation of shock conditionsin conventional gas dynamics .  the purposes of this paper are ..cover the present more general case .that every flow and field quantitydownstream from the shock wave isexpressible separately in terms ofthe known values of these quantitiesupstream from the shock wave .in this rearranged form of the equations,various effects of the shockwave can be easily read off .the shock conditions along the samelines as in conventional gas dynamics .
