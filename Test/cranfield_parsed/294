an investigation of laminar transitional and turbulentheat transfer on blunt-nosed bodies in hypersonic flow ..Acresci,r.j. and mackenzie,d.a..Bj. ae. scs. 27, 1960..Wan investigation of laminar transitional and turbulentheat transfer on blunt-nosed bodies in hypersonic flow .  laminar, transitional, and turbulent heating rates have beenmeasured by means of the shrouded model technique .  thereynolds number was varied over a ninefold range,. the enthalpyratio (stagnation to wall) varied from 2.3 to approximately 1.5 .two different pressure distributions were imposed on the modelwhich consisted of a spherically capped cone .  the experimental data are compared to the laminar hypersonicboundary-layer theory and shown to be in good agreement on theconical portion of the model .  on the spherical portion the dataare approximately 20 per cent higher than the theoreticalprediction .  some of this discrepancy can be attributed to radiation tothe nose of the model .  the fully developed turbulent heat-transfer data are comparedto two theories ..  (1) a relatively simple turbulent theory which isbased on recent theoretical work and which takes into accountthe upstream history of the boundary layer, and (2) the flat-platereference-enthalpy theory, which depends on only /local/conditions .  although both theories are in reasonable agreement withthe data, the latter method is simpler and somewhat moreaccurate .  for transitional flow the theory mentioned first can be readilymodified in order to permit reasonable estimates of transitionalheat transfer to be obtained .  on this basis it is possible toestimate laminar, transitional, and fully developed turbulent heattransfer under hypersonic blunt-body conditions .  the behavior of transition reynolds number based onmomentum thickness is also discussed and shown to be in quantitativeagreement with recent shock-tube measurements .
