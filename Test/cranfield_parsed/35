stagnation point of a blunt body in hypersonic flow ..Ali,t.y. and geiger,r.e..Bj. ae. scs. 24, 1957, 25..Wstagnation point of a blunt body in hypersonic flow .  the purpose of this paper is to present a method of calculationdevised to yield all the important information on the symmetricinviscid hypersonic flow in the stagnation point region of a bluntbody .  the problem is the same as that considered by hayeswho used a slightly different approach .  it is demonstrated thathayes' results are valid in the stagnation point region and canhence be considered a basis for constructing less restrictedsolutions .  equations are presented giving velocity, pressure, detachmentdistance, and vorticity .  the values of shock detachmentdistance and body pressure coefficient are compared withexperimental data for spheres .  the pressure comparison shows thatthe results of hayes and the theory presented herein represent abetter approximation than the newtonian impact theory forhypersonic mach numbers .  in conclusion, the possibility of refinements to this analysis isdiscussed .
