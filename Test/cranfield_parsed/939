some explicit solutions for constant-temp . magnetogasdynamic channel flow ..Aberlot,r.r..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 748..Wsome explicit solutions for constant-temp . magnetogasdynamic channel flow .in order to simplify the process of estimating the aerodynamicloading on the after portions of slender vehicles, it isfrequently assumed that there is no nose-tail interaction .  it isthe purpose of this note to show that, aside from boundary-layereffects, this assumption is not warranted when the nosehypersonic-similarity parameter, tan, is of the order of unity, orgreater .  physically speaking, the entropy change associatedwith a strong bow wave reduces the stagnation pressuredown-stream of the shock, and hence, lowers the dynamic pressure inthe vicinity of the tail .
