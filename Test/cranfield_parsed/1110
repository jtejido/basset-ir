on supersonic flow past a slightly yawing cone ..Astone,ah..Bj. math. phys. 27, 1948, 67..Won supersonic flow past a slightly yawing cone .  this paper is concernedwith the motion of a circular cone, ofnot too blunt an angle, through air at highspeed .  if the direction of motion ofthe cone coincides with its axis of symmetry,the resulting air flow is well known .here we consider the perturbation producedby a small /yaw/--i.e., the case inwhich the cone is moving not quite in thedirection of its axis .  the results areconfirmed experimentally, and have applicationsto ballistics, though we are notconcerned with the latter here,. they mayalso be useful as providing a check onvarious approximate methods of widerapplicability .  the square of the yaw isneglected--an approximation of which thevalidity is discussed .  (similarmethods can be applied to the second-order effectsof the yaw, which are also of ballisticsignificance,. but the computations have notyet been completed .)  it should beobserved that, because of the lack of symmetry,the flow will be neitherirrotational nor isentropic .
