a correlation of nose-bluntness induced pressures oncylindrical and conical after-bodies at hypersonicspeeds ..Agreenberg,r.a..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 359..Wa correlation of nose-bluntness induced pressures oncylindrical and conical after-bodies at hypersonicspeeds .van hise, in his detailed study of the nose-bluntness-inducedpressures on cylindrical afterbodies, shows that, startinga few nose diameters aft of the nose-afterbody junction, thesepressures are correlated with the parameteras predicted by the blast-wave analogy .  chernyi developed amodified form of the blast-wave analogy which takes into accountthe addition of energy to the flow by a thin afterbody .  heshowed that for thin afterbodies and hypersonic speeds, thepressure distribution, plotted as should correlate withthe parameter .  the purpose of this noteis to show that the above correlation techniques may becombined into a form such that pressures on cylindrical and conicalafterbodies are correlated by one parameter .
