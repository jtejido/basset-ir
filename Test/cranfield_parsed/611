an approximate solution of the compressible laminarboundary layer on a flat plate ..Amonaghan,r.j..Brae tn. aero.2025..Wan approximate solution of the compressible laminarboundary layer on a flat plate .  following a major assumption that enthalpy and velocity are dependentonly on local conditions, an enthalpy-velocity relationis obtained for the laminar boundary layer on a flat plate wheresubscripts p refer to the plate, 1 to the free stream and e to theequilibrium temperature condition at the plate .  when compared withgeneral results, this relation (exact for prandtl number o = 1)gives a close approximation to crocco's numerical results for o = 0.725and 1.25, up to .  using the above relation in conjunction with the approximateviscosity-temperature relation suggested by chapman and rubesin, andwith young's suggested first approximation for shearing stress it isshown that close approximations to displacement thickness and velocitydistribution are given by and where and which serves to define c .  these have the advantage of being algebraic in form whereas previousresults have involved complex numerical integrations for individualcases .
