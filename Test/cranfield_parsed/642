the buckling strength of a uniform circular cylinderloaded in axial compression ..Asobey,a.j..Brae r. struct,279, 1962..Wthe buckling strength of a uniform circular cylinderloaded in axial compression .  the theoretical estimation of the buckling strength of a cylinderloaded in axial compression is improved by the use of a morerepresentative deflected form for the buckled cylinder than haspreviously been used .  kempner's buckling strength for dead weightloading is reduced by 18 .  the presentation of the magnitude anddistribution of the constraint system required to maintain the mode isnovel and instructive .
