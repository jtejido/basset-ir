inelastic buckling of initially imperfect cylindricalshells subject to axial compression ..Alee,l.h.n..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 87..Winelastic buckling of initially imperfect cylindricalshells subject to axial compression .  an analytical and experimental study is made for inelasticinstability of initially imperfect cylindrical shells subject toaxial compression .  donnell's equations and the principle ofvirtual work are adapted to determine the effects of initialimperfections on the buckling modes and the critical bucklingstresses .  the deformation theory and the incremental theoryof plastic stress-strain relationships are both considered .  theexperimental results of ten tests on specimens made of aluminumalloy 3003-0 are presented .  comparison of experimental withtheoretical results indicates that the application of thedeformation theory provides a fairly accurate prediction of bucklingstrength, but fails in this case to yield a correct description ofpost-buckling behavior .  on the other hand, the application ofthe incremental theory, which is mathematically and physicallymore rigorous, leads to an overestimation of buckling strength,even though initial imperfections are considered .  this paradoxhas existed for years, and remains to be resolved .
