some current and proposed investigations into the flowfor slender delta and other wings in unsteady motion ..Alambourne,n.c..Barc 21,844, 1960..Wsome current and proposed investigations into the flowfor slender delta and other wings in unsteady motion .  the practical need for researchinto the aerodynamics ofslender delta wings in unsteady motion hasbeen emphasized in a recentpaper by zbrozek .  two important aspectsare ..  -      formation and presence of      leading-edge vortices .      with oscillatory or transient      modes of longitudinal (or      chordwise) bending .  the first of the aspectsabove, has already been brieflydiscussed in ref. 2 .  one feature ofthe flow with leading-edge vorticeswhich seems to be of particularsignificance to the dynamic behaviourof a wing is the shedding of vorticityat the leading edge as well as atthe trailing edge .  any time-dependentmotion, or distortion, of the wingleads to a change in the rate at whichvorticity is shed .  with moreconventional types of flow, the freevorticity being shed only from thetrailing edge has diminishing influenceon the wing, but when the freevorticity is shed from the leading edge,in passing downstream, itremains close to the upper surface of thewing .  it might be expectedthen, that, although the magnitudes of theunsteady forces may not begreatly affected for a slender delta, thetime delays associated withthe forces may be significantly differentfor the attached andseparated regimes of leading-edge flow .
