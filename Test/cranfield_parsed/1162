force-test investigation of the stability and controlcharacteristics of a 1/8 scale model of a tilt-wingvertical take-off and landing airplane ..Atosti,l.p..Bnasa tn.d44, 1960..Wforce-test investigation of the stability and controlcharacteristics of a 1/8 scale model of a tilt-wingvertical take-off and landing airplane .  a force-test investigation hasbeen made to determine theaerodynamic characteristics of a scalemodel of a tilt-wingvertical-take-off-and-landing airplane in theshort- and long-wing configurations .the model had two 6-blade dual-rotatingpropellers that were notinterconnected mounted on a wing that couldbe tilted up to an incidence angleof about 90 for vertical take-off and landing .  the investigation included measurementsof both the longitudinaland lateral stability and controlcharacteristics in the normal-forward-flight, transition, and hovering ranges .tests in the forward-flightand transition conditions were made atvarious wing incidences and powerconditions .  tests in the hoveringcondition were made in the presenceof the ground .  the data are presentedwithout analysis .
