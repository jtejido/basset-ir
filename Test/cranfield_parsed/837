inelastic behaviour of structures subjected to cyclicthermal and mechanical stressing conditions ..Apadlog,j., huff,r.d. and holloway,g.f..Bwadc tr 60-271, 1960..Winelastic behaviour of structures subjected to cyclicthermal and mechanical stressing conditions .  a general analytical procedure is outlined for structures subjected tovarying thermal and mechanical stressing conditions .  consideration isgiven to the accumulation of time-independent plastic strains and creepstrains .  stress-strain-temperature-time relations for uniaxial andmultiaxial stresses are defined, based on various material behaviorassumptions .  several of the assumptions are compared with a limitednumber of time-varying temperature and uniaxial stress tests .  the procedure is illustrated by its application to uniaxial stressproblems in which /planes originally plane remain plane/ and to planestress plate problems .  a solution, based on the influence coefficientapproach to the plane stress plate problem, is obtained which isapplicable to all plate plan forms, edge boundary conditions, andinplane thermal and mechanical loading conditions .  from the predicted inelastic behavior of a three-bar structuresubjected to cyclic thermal and mechanical loading conditions, it isshown that eventual failure could result from large permanentdeformation accumulations, tensile rupture, or thermal-stress-fatigue .  a sample plate with a centrally located hole was analyzed for twocycles of a time-varying temperature and edge stress condition .  bothplastic strain reversals and plastic strain growths were predicted atthe hole .  however, a test-theory comparison indicated failure bycreep-rupture .
