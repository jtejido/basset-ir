heat transfer near the forward stagnation point ofa body of revolution ..Asibulkin,m.j..Bj. ae. scs. 19, 1952, 570..Wheat transfer near the forward stagnation point ofa body of revolution .in order to determine the temperature distribution over abody moving through the atmosphere, a knowledge of thelocal heat-transfer coefficients is required .  for slendersharp-nosed bodies, the heat-transfer coefficients are frequentlyapproximated by using the comparable flat-plate values .however, for blunt-nosed bodies, flat-plate solutions are notapplicable near the forward stagnation point .  since the greatest rateof heat transfer may occur at the forward stagnation point, itsvalue should be investigated .  in this note a theoretical solutionis given for the heat transfer near the forward stagnation point ofa body of revolution assuming laminar, incompressible, low-speedflow .  the comparable solution for two-dimensional flow hasbeen given by squire .  in the case of a blunt-nosed body movingwith supersonic velocity, the flow behind the central portion ofthe bow wave is subsonic, and it is possible that a low-speedsolution, using as /free-stream/ conditions those behind the centerof the bow wave, will apply near the stagnation point .
