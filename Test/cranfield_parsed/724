structural acoustic proof testing ..Aschjeldrup,h.c..Bair eng. 1959..Wstructural acoustic proof testing .with the introduction of high-poweredpropulsion systems, and paralleling theircontinued development, anaccompanying increase in acoustical problems has arisen .  of these acoustical problems, that ofacoustical fatigue failures has become paramountin the eyes of the structural engineer .  aircraftdesigned to normal strength requirements havebeen known literally to fall apart under acousticalloading .  this problem has required muchendeavour to produce a solution, and considerablestructural research, based upon results of siren orother testing, have proved inadequate .  thisfailure to find a satisfactory solution has resultedin the conviction that the final proof of a designcan be found only in proof testing .  proof testing,in the acoustic fatigue sense, is the testing of adesign structure in a simulated acousticalenvironment for a period of time long enough to assureequality with design life .
