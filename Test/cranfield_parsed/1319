real gas effects in flow over blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds ..Anagamatsu, h.t., geiger r.e. and sheet, r.e..Barc 21, 083, june 1959 ..Wreal gas effects in flow over blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds .a hypersonic shock tunnel has been developed to investigate theaerodynamic characteristics of flow over bodies at conditions comparable tothose encountered by ballistic missiles and satellites re-entering theatmosphere . some results for a shock velocity of over 50,000 ft/sec inthe shock tube portion of the facility are presented . static pressureinvestigations were made in the nozzle for different stagnationconditions in order to determine the flow condition and the expansionprocess .the results of the investigation on representative blunt bodies athypersonic mach numbers and nozzle stagnation temperatures up toapproximately 6000degreek are presented . these include body pressuredistributions, shock wave shapes, detachment distances, and photographsof the luminous gas region in the shock layer . it is seen that theshock detachment distance is smaller at higher stagnation temperaturesowing to the real gas effects . for the hemisphere the pressuredistribution was less than that predicted by the modified newtonian theory for all stagnation temperatures . for a 50degree cone-hemisphere thepressure distribution and the shock wave detachment distance wereappreciably affected by the real gas effects .the experimentally obtained shock wave shape and the approximateboundary layer on a flat plate are correlated with the analyticalprediction . some preliminary results for the detached shock wave producedby a blunt two-dimensional body in a low density flow at a mach numberof 19.6 are presented .
