similar solutions of a free convection boundary layerequation for an electrically conducting fluid ..Areeves,b.l..Ba.r.s. jnl. 31, 1961, 517..Wsimilar solutions of a free convection boundary layerequation for an electrically conducting fluid .  author investigates the existence of a class of similar solutionsfor free convection from a vertical flat plate, such as are known forfree convection in a nonconducting fluid .  the magnetic field actstransversely to the fluid motion and is assumed to remain constantin the direction perpendicular to the plate .  this introduces intothe momentum equation a retarding force which is a function onlyof x, the distance along the plate length .  for similarity it isfound that the magnetic inductance must vary as .  ifthe plate temperature is constant .  if n = 0, the magneticinductance is constant while the plate temperature increases linearlywith x .
