rocket propulsion systems for interplanetary flight ..Asutton, g.p..Bj. aero. sc. v. 26, october 1959 ..Wrocket propulsion systems for interplanetary flight .a comparison is made of several different propulsion systems forinterplanetary flight . liquid and solid propellant rockets, propulsionsystems which use nuclear energy sources, are heating rockets,magneto-plasma devices, ion rocket propulsion, solar heating rockets, and solarsails are briefly described and their current status reviewed . engineperformance requirements for different interplanetary missions areestablished . these several propulsion systems are then compared on thebasis of several performance criteria, environmental characteristics,vehicle requirements, reliability, current status, growth potential, and efficiency . predictions on various propulsion system capabilities andan analysis of multiple rocket engine reliability is included . it isconcluded that electrical rockets are superior for long-timeinter-planetary flight applications, and that chemical rockets aresatisfactory for most of the immediate applications in /near/ space . none of the several propulsion schemes discussed can be rejected until furthertechnical work has been accomplished .
