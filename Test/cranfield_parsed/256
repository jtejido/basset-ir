an experimental study of the glancing interaction betweena shock wave and a turbulent boundary layer ..Astanbrook,a..Barc cp.555, 1960..Wan experimental study of the glancing interaction betweena shock wave and a turbulent boundary layer .  an experimental study has been made at mach numbers from 1.6 to 2.0 ofthe interaction between the turbulentboundary layer on a side wall of a windtunnel and the shock wave produced bya plate mounted on the wall .  underthese conditions the shock wave boundarylayer interaction was threedimensional at least over the regioninvestigated (up to 10 boundary layerthicknesses from the plate) .  it wasfound that the boundary layer wasseparated by a shock wave of strengthtype occur on the sides of fuselages atthe wing fuselage junction and maytherefore be important with regard to thedesign of waisted shapes .
