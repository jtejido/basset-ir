on the bending of a clamped plate ..Aweinstein,a., rock,d.h..Bq. app. math. 2, 1944, 262..Won the bending of a clamped plate .  the present paper contains an applicationof a recently developed variationalmethod to the boundary value problem of thebending of a clamped plate ofarbitrary shape .  it will be shown that this problemcan be linked to the simpler problemof the equilibrium of a membrane by a chainof intermediate problems, which can besolved explicitly and in finite form in termsof the membrane problem .  in theintermediate problems, the deflection convergesuniformly in the domain of the plateof the clamped plate, and the derivativesof all orders of the deflection convergeuniformly in every domain completely interiorto the plate .  (in the ritz method, not eventhe convergence of the slopes can beguaranteed .)  the method yields numericalresults for plates of all shapes for whichthe membrane problem (which we shall callthe base problem) admits an explicitsolution .  as an example we shall consider aclamped square plate under a uniform load .this problem has been the object ofnumerous investigations, some of which aretheoretical, while others are purely numerical,use infinite simple and double series,and operate with an infinite number oflinear equations and an infinite number ofunknowns .  an inspection of the generalformulae derived in the present paper,formulae which become simple in numericalapplications, would show how some of thenumerical methods might be renderedrigorous .  the convergence of higherderivatives is of great practical interest forthe approximate computation of the stresses .
