a free-flight investigation of ablation of a bluntbody to a mach number of 13 .1..Awinters,c.w., witte,w.g., rashis,b. and hopko,h.n..Bnasa tn.d1500, 1962..Wa free-flight investigation of ablation of a bluntbody to a mach number of 13 .1.  a five-stage rocket-propelledresearch-vehicle system was flown to a maximummach number of 13.1 at an altitude ofapproximately 78,000 feet to determineablation characteristics of teflon in freeflight .  continuous in-flightmeasurements were made using sensors developed bythe national aeronautics and spaceadministration .  the sensors were locatedon the blunted face of a nose coneconstructed from teflon, with one at the stagnationpoint and two others at a surfacedistance of 0.62 radius on opposite sides of thestagnation point .  theablated-length measurements were in close agreement withanalytical predictions .  theanalytical predictions, upon inclusion of thepertinent material property values,should be applicable to other materials as wellas teflon .
