heat transfer to constant property laminar boundarylayer flows with power function free stream velocityand wall temperature variation ..Alevy,s..Bj.ae.scs. 19, 1952..Wheat transfer to constant property laminar boundarylayer flows with power function free stream velocityand wall temperature variation .  numerical computations have been performed for theboundary-layer form of the energy equation for incompressible flowswith power-function variation of free-stream velocity (u =cx) and of wall temperature (t = ax), the pertinent solutionsof the momentum equation in this case being those of hartree .the numerical computations given herein are to some extent arepetition of those given by schuh and by chapman and rubesin,the object of the present computations being the resolution ofdiscrepancies appearing in the previous solutions and an extension oftheir range .  ibm machine calculations were employed in thefinite difference calculation presently utilized, the results thereofcovering a range of wall-temperature function exponents fromvalues of m(4, 1, 0, -0.0904) .  the accuracy of the numericalcomputations is examined in detail, and the accuracy of thecomputed functions at the wall, which determine the heat-transferrate, is estimated to be within 2 per cent .  examination of the results reveals that the results of schuhfor the flat plate are in error .  for the range of the calculations,it was found that the local heat-transfer coefficient can, with theexception of large negative values, be expressed within 5per cent aswhere the exponent of the prandtl number varies from 0.254to 0.367 for -0.0904 and where the functioncan be approximated by the equation
