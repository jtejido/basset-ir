some problems of polar missile control ..Abest,d..Bj.roy.ae.soc., 64, 1960..Wsome problems of polar missile control .  a polar-controlled missile is one in which manoeuvreis carried out by rotations about roll and pitch axes,that is, in the manner of a conventional aeroplane .  thispaper discusses some problems in the application of thisform of control to homing missiles .  in comparison with the alternative cartesianconfiguration, this method presents some special designproblems .  in the former case, it is often possible toresolve the motion into two planes and consider thepitch and yaw control systems as independenttwo-dimensional problems .  this simplification is notpossible in the case of polar control and it is usuallynecessary to consider the whole three-dimensionalsystem .  the equations of motion which result are, ingeneral, not susceptible to analysis .  because of this,the design of control systems requires extensive use ofsimulators .
