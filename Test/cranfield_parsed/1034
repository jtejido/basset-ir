note on creep buckling of columns ..A.B.Wnote on creep buckling of columns .  a long, thin-walled cylindrical shell is loaded by a uniformexternal pressure .  equations are developed for the time behaviorof the shape of the cross section under the following conditions ..formations expressible by a power creep law,. (b) the initial andsubsequent mode shape of the deviations from circularity of anycross section is two-lobed,. and (c) the shell construction is of thesandwich type, with concentric cylindrical membranes takingnormal stresses and an annular core supporting shear withoutdeformation .  explicit solutions are obtained for the particularcase of the cubic creep law .  it is shown that the nondimensionalamplitude of the cross-sectional mode shape (briefly, shapefactor) will become infinite in a finite time .  curves of shape factorversus time and of collapse time versus initial value of the shapefactor are presented .  also given are an explicit expression forand a curve of the expected variation in collapse time owing touncontrollable deviations from a nominal initial value of theshape factor .  it is shown that the expected variation is smallif the nominal initial shape factor value is sufficiently large .
