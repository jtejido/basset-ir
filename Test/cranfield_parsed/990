a rapid approximate method for determining velocity distribution onimpeller blades of centrifugal compressors ..Astanitz, j.d. and prian, v.d..Bnaca tn 2421, 1951 ..Wa rapid approximate method for determining velocity distribution onimpeller blades of centrifugal compressors .a rapid approximate method of analysis was developed for bothcompressible and incompressible, nonviscous flow through radial- ormixed-flow centrifugal compressors with arbitrary hub and shroud contours andwith arbitrary blade shape . the method of analysis is used to determine approximately the velocities everywhere along the blade surfaces, butno information concerning the variation in velocity across the passagebetween blades is given .in eight numerical examples for two-dimensional flow, covering a fairlywide range of flow rate, impeller-tip speed, number of blades, and blade curvature, the velocity distribution along the blade surfaces wasobtained by the approximate method of analysis and compared with thevelocities obtained by relaxation methods . in all cases the agreementbetween the approximate solutions and the relaxation solutions wassatisfactory except at the impeller tip where the velocities obtained by the approximate method did not, in general, become equal on bothsurfaces of the blade as required by the joukowski condition .
