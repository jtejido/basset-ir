an approximate treatment of unsteady heat conductionin semi-infinite solids with variable thermal properties ..Ayang,k.t. and szewczyk,a..Bj. heat trans. asme trans. 81, 1959, 251..Wan approximate treatment of unsteady heat conductionin semi-infinite solids with variable thermal properties .  this very short paper presents an approximate procedure for thecalculation of unsteady heat conduction in semi-infinite solidswith variable thermal properties .  it is claimed to be animprovement over previous efforts in this area since it yields physicallysensible results for cases where thermal properties have a largedependence on temperature .  instead of using polynomials torepresent an unsteady temperature profile an exponential form is used .good agreement is shown for several cases where the method ofthe paper is compared with exact solutions .
