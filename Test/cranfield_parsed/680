generalized conical flow fields in supersonic wing theory ..Alomax, h. and heaslett, m.a..Bnaca tn 2497, september 1951 ..Wgeneralized conical flow fields in supersonic wing theory .linearized, compressible-flow analysis is applied to the study ofquasi-conical supersonic wing theory . single-integral equations arederived which relate either the loading to the shape of a liftingsurface or the thickness of a symmetrical wing to the pressuredistribution for triangular wings with subsonic leading edges . the forms ofthese equations and their inversions are simplified through theintroduction of the finite part and the generalized principal part of anintegral .applications of the theory, in the lifting case, include previouslyknown results . in the nonlifting case, it is shown that for a specified pressure distribution the theory does not always predict a uniquethickness distribution . this is demonstrated for a triangular plan form having a constant pressure gradient in the stream direction .
