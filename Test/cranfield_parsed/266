exact solution of the neumann problem . calculationfor non- circulatory plane and axially symmetric flowsabout or within arbitrary boundaries ..Asmith,a.n.c. and pierce,j..B3rd nat. con. app. mech. 1958..Wexact solution of the neumann problem . calculationfor non- circulatory plane and axially symmetric flowsabout or within arbitrary boundaries .  an exact general method of solvingthe neumann or second boundary-valueproblem has been developed and has beenapplied to the calculation oflow-speed flows about or within bodies ofalmost any shape, provided the flow iseither plane or has axial symmetry .solid-body, inlet, and purely internalflow problems can be solved .  themethod is capable of dealing with severalbodies at once in the presence ofone another, and consequently interferenceproblems can be treated with ease .boundaries need not be solid, that is,flows involving area suction can becalculated .  velocities can be computednot only for points on the surface ofthe body but for the entire flow field .  a surface source distribution isused as a basis for solution .  thisleads to a fredholm integral equationof the second kind, which is solved asa set of linear algebraic equations,usually by a modified seidel method .at the present time the solution isprogramed on the ibm 704 edpm to solvethe flow about any body that has thepreviously mentioned characteristicsand whose profile can be definedsatisfactorily by no more than 300coordinate points .  a number of solutionsare presented, to show both the scopeof the method and its accuracy .computations require from three minutesto two hours, depending upon theshape of the body and the number of pointsused to define it .
