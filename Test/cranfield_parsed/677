methods for calculating the lift distribution of wings /subsoniclifting surface theory/ ..A.Br + m 2884, r.a.e. rep. aero. 2353. a.r.c. 13,439. january 1950 ..Wmethods for calculating the lift distribution of wings /subsoniclifting surface theory/ .this report contains some fairly simple and economic methods forcalculating the load distribution on wings of any plan form based onthe conceptions of lifting surface theory . the computer work requiredis only a small fraction of that of existing methods with comparableaccuracy . this is achieved by a very careful choice of the positionsof pivotal points, by plotting once for all those parts of the downwashintegral which occur frequently and by a consequent application ofapproximate integration methods similar to those devised by the authorfor lifting line problems .the basis of the method is to calculate the local lift and pitchingmoment at a number of chordwise sections from a set of linear equationssatisfying the downwash conditions at two pivotal points in eachsection . interpolation functions of trigonometrical form are used forspanwise integration both in setting up the downwash equations and ingetting the resultant forces on the wing from the local forces . thepreliminary chordwise integrations for the downwash are predigested ina series of charts/figs.1-6/,.it is these which make the method apractical computing proposition .the theory is outlined in sections 2-5,.section 6 deals with thesolution of the linear equation and section 7 with the resultant forceson the wing . some examples are worked out in section 8 to compare withother methods,. one solution is given in full detail in tables 8-30 as a guide for computers . appendices i-vi discuss more carefully somesalient points of the mathematical theory, and appendix vii is intendedto instruct the computer how to carry out the steps of the calculation .
