velocity and temperature distributions in the turbulentwake behind a heated body of revolution ..Ahall,a.a. and hislop,g.s..Bproc.cam.phil.s. 34, 1938, 345..Wvelocity and temperature distributions in the turbulentwake behind a heated body of revolution .recently (see abstract 954 (1938)) goldstein made calculations basedon theories of vorticity transfer, of the distributions of velocity andtemperature in the turbulent wake behind a heated body of revolution,and the present authors now record an experimental determination ofthese distributions in a low-turbulence wind tunnel .  difficulty wasexperienced in obtaining a truly symmetrical wake and observationshave been reduced to mean values, curves of which are given .
