on the coupling between heat and mass transfer ..Atewfik,o.e..Bj. ae. scs. 28, 1962, 1009..Won the coupling between heat and mass transfer .in mixtures of two different gases or liquids, one constituentwill migrate spontaneously toward the warmer parts, andthe other toward the colder parts .  this phenomenon, knownas the soret effect, and its converse the dufour effect, werediscovered as early as 1856 and 1873 respectively .  the twoeffects can also be considered as a simultaneous transport ofmass and heat, or as a coupling between heat and mass transfer .the effects of this coupling have been neglected in allinvestigations of heat transfer in multicomponent flow systems so far,on the a priori assumption that they are small .  in a recentpublication however, it was shown that they can be large inlaminar-boundary-layer-type flows with helium injection .turbulent-boundary-layer measurements and an analysis conductedat the heat transfer laboratory clearly showed significanteffects of the coupling on heat transfer and adiabatic walltemperature .  from additional measurements, the results of whichare presented below, it is possible to separate the heat flux at themodel wall into one part depending on the temperature gradientand a second part caused by the coupling .  it is shown thatthe latter exceeds the former, and hence the coupling may notbe neglected a priori without careful consideration .
