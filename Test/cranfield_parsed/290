dynamic stability of a missile in rolling flight ..Abolz,r.e..Bj. ae. scs. 19, 1952..Wdynamic stability of a missile in rolling flight .  the paper sets down the equations of motion for a symmetricrolling missile with respect to axes attached to the missile .  themissile may be jet (or rocket) propelled or coasting underaccelerating or decelerating conditions, respectively, wherein thevariable rolling velocity is derived from intentionally orunintentionally /canted/ fins and or wings .  the equations contain a force and moment system thatincludes, in addition to the usual forces and moments, those due tomagnus effects, misaligned surfaces, canted surfaces, jetmisalignment, and the linear accelerations in the plane normal to themissile axis .  the results present general stability criteria for a rolling missilewhich are summarized in the /discussion of stability ./
