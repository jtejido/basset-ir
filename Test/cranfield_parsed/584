conduction of heat in a solid with a power law of heattransfer at its surface ..Ajaeger,j.c..Bproc. cam.phil. s. 46, 1950, 634..Wconduction of heat in a solid with a power law of heattransfer at its surface .  the nonlinear boundary value problem, whereand m are constants, is solved formally by firstintroducing power series in t for the unknown temperatureand flux at the surface and then determining the coefficientsin those series .  in this manner the temperature function isdetermined as a series of repeated integrals of errorfunctions .  the convergence is rapid only for small values of t .the special cases and generalizations ofthe condition at the surface for which the same methodapplies, are noted .  surface temperatures are also found bymethods of difference equations, where t is not limited tosmall values .  graphs of these temperatures correspondingto various laws of heat transfer at the surface are shown .
