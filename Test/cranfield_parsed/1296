non-equilibrium expansions of air with coupled chemicalreactions ..Aeschenroeder,a.q., boyer,d. and hall,j.g..Bphys. fluids, 1962..Wnon-equilibrium expansions of air with coupled chemicalreactions .  analysis and solutions of the streamtube gasdynamics involving coupled chemical rate equationsare carried out .  results are presented for airflowsalong the surface of blunt bodies and throughhypersonic nozzles .  speeds and altitudes correspondingto re-entry were selected to obtain initialconditions for the external flow calculations .  conditionsappropriate to hypersonic tunnel testingwere chosen for the nozzle flow calculations .  compositionhistories are shown for a kinetic mechanismincluding 6 species and 14 reactions .  gas-dynamic effectsof nonequilibrium processes qualitativelyresemble those reported earlier .  however, the freezingprocess is complicated by the coupling of thenitric oxide shuffle reactions with the dissociation-recombinationreactions .  in many cases ofhypersonic nozzle flows where the energy in nitrogen dissociationis significant, the fast shuffle reactionsprevent nitrogen-atom freezing which would otherwise occurif three-body recombination were the onlyprocess operating .  nitric oxide concentrationsundershoot the equilibrium values if the ratio ofnitric oxide to oxygen molecule concentrationsexceeds unity in the freezing region .  this depletionof nitric oxide leads to nitrogen-atom freezing .
