the bending of a sectorial plate ..Acarrier,g.f..Bj. app. mech. 11, 1944, 134..Wthe bending of a sectorial plate .  the problem of evaluating the bending moments,existing in a uniformly loaded clamped plate having the formof a sector of a ring, is one which arises in connection withthe stress analysis of reinforced piston heads and in otherdesign problems .  in this paper, expressions are derivedfor the bending moments along the edges of such a plate .similar problems, i.e., those of the clamped rectangularplate under uniform pressure, under a centralconcentrated load, and that of the simply supported sector of adisk under uniform pressure, have been discussed byprevious authors .  the general approach used in theforegoing problems is adopted in the present case ,. aconsiderable reduction in the computational work is achieved,however, by the use of an integral-equation method ofsolving the boundary-condition equations .  numericalresults are obtained for plates of various dimensions, andthe edge moment distributions are plotted for these cases .curves are also plotted which indicate the relationshipexisting between the maximum bending moments derivedfor sectorial plates and those previously obtained forclamped rectangular plates of similar size .
