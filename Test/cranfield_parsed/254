boundary layers with suction and injection . a reviewof published work on skin friction ..Acraven,a.h..Bcoa r136..Wboundary layers with suction and injection . a reviewof published work on skin friction .  available data on the effects of suction and injection on skinfriction are summarised and compared .  it is shown that injection into a turbulent boundary layer canproduce a skin friction coefficient lower than the laminar value at thesame reynolds number on an impermeable plate .
