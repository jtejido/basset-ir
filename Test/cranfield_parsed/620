earth satellite observations and the upper atmosphere ..Apriester, w., martin, h.a. and kramp, k..Bnature, 188, pp 200-204. 1960 ..Wearth satellite observations and the upper atmosphere .atmospheric densities have been derived from artificial satellites inaltitudes 200-700 km. and from rockets up to about 200 km. toconsolidate the two sets of data, h.k. kallmann suggested a model with aexact form of this curve has now been derived . corrections for the is excellent .very close correlation between atmospheric density variations/h180 km./and the solar 20-cm. radiation implies that the origin of the'solareffect'may lie in the absorption of solar ultra-violet radiation .the atmospheric density curve between 180 and 200 km. shows atemperature inversion in the fl-layer . it is not yet possible to decide whether solar ultra-violet radiation as well as the solar he line andsolar x-ray radiation contribute to the heating of the fl-layer .diurnal and seasonal density variations at altitudes 210, 562 and 660km. have been derived from variations in acceleration of threesatellites/sputnik 3, vanguard 1 and 2/ . group averages of diurnalvariations are taken from different dates within the periodmay 15, 1958-october 1, 1959 . physcal conditions in the upperatmosphere are briefly summarized ..the'solar effect'originates in thefl-layer as a result of heating by the solar he line at 304 a. diurnaldensity variation at 210 km. is only a few per cent . absorption ofsolar electromagnetic radiation in the f2-layer, and large heatconductivity cause intense diurnal density and temperature variations above
