theoretical investigation of the flow field about bluntnosed bodies in supersonic flight ..Avaglio-laurin,r. and ferri,a..Bj. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 761..Wtheoretical investigation of the flow field about bluntnosed bodies in supersonic flight .  a numerical method ofr obtaining the solution to the inverseproblem of the flow behind a given detached shock to any desiredaccuracy is presented .  the cases of zero and small incidenceare considered .  the combination of sets of such solutionssatisfying prescribed boundary conditions (body shapes) is described .particular attention is devoted to the analysis of the sonic andsubsonic region of the flow field .  convergence and stability ofthe stepwise integration from the shock in the elliptic region arediscussed .  numerical examples are also included .
