laminar heat transfer in tubes under slip-flow conditions ..Asparrow,e.m. and lin,s.h..Basme paper 61-wa-165..Wlaminar heat transfer in tubes under slip-flow conditions .the effects of low-density phenomena on thefully developed heat-transfer characteristicsfor laminar flow in tubes has been studiedanalytically .  consideration is given to theslip-flow regime wherein the major rarefactioneffects are manifested as velocity andtemperature jumps at the tube wall .  theanalysis is carried out for both uniform walltemperature and uniform wall heat flux .in both cases, the slip-flow nusselt numbersare lower than those for continuum flowand decrease with increasing mean free path .extension of the results is made to includethe effects of shear work at the wall,temperature jump modifications for a moving fluid,and thermal creep .
