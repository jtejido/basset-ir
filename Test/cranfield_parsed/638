longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at low subsonicspeeds of a highly swept wing utilizing nose deflectionfor control ..Aspencer,b..Bnasa tn.d1482, 1962..Wlongitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at low subsonicspeeds of a highly swept wing utilizing nose deflectionfor control .  an investigation has been conductedin the langley 7- by 10-foot transonictunnel at low subsonic speeds to determinethe longitudinal aerodynamiccharacteristics associated with deflection of thenose section of a highly swept deltawing having an aspect ratio of 1.33 .  in orderto illustrate the effectiveness ofthis forward control, the longitudinal controlcharacteristics are also presentedfor the wing with upper-and lower-surfacesplit flaps located at the trailingedge .  comparison between the longitudinalaerodynamic characteristics of the wingutilizing the nose control and those ofthe wing utilizing the upper-surfacesplit flap located at the trailing edgeindicated similar control effectivenessfor high control deflections (15) andsimilar values of trimmed lift-drag ratiowith increasing lift coefficient .  useof the nose control, however, indicated alower value of trimmed angle of attackfor a given value of trimmed liftcoefficient than that realized from use ofthe upper-surface split flap .  furtherreductions in trimmed angle of attackfor a given value of trimmed liftcoefficient may be realized from deflectionof the lower-surface split flap at thewing trailing edge in combination withthe nose control and would be accompaniedby large reductions in lift-drag ratio .
