buckling of thin single- and multi-layer conical and cylindricalshells with rotationally symmetric stresses ..Ap. p. radkowski.Bavco manufacturing corporation.Wbuckling of thin single- and multi-layer conical and cylindricalshells with rotationally symmetric stresses .the buckling of simply supported, thin, single- and multi-layer conicalshells under axially symmetrical loading is analyzed in this paper .the results are presented in a compact manner so that they may be easilyused for design and/or experimental purposes .  the results are comparedwith known experimental values .
