buckling of core-stabilized cylinders under axisymmetric externalloads ..Adon o. brush and bo o. almroth.Blockheed missiles and space company.Wbuckling of core-stabilized cylinders under axisymmetric externalloads .an equation is derived for the elastic stability of a circularcylindrical shell which is filled with a soft elastic core and is subjected togeneral axially-symmetric lateral pressure combined with a centralaxial force .  numerical results are given for three lateral pressuredistributions of interest in rocket motor case analysis..  uniformpressure, linearly varying pressure, and a circumferential bandof pressure located at an arbitrary distance from one end of thecylinder .  comparison is made with results of previous theoreticaland experimental investigations, where available .
