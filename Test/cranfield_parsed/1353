investigation of a two-step nozzle in the langley 11in ..A hypersonic tunnel ..Bmclellan,c.h.naca tn.2171, 1950..Winvestigation of a two-step nozzle in the langley 11in . hypersonic tunnel .  flow surveys have been made inthe first of several nozzles to beinvestigated in the langley 11-inchhypersonic tunnel .  the nozzle wasdesigned by the method of characteristicsfor a mach number of 6.98 .  twostep expanded the air in thehorizontal plane to a mach number of 4.36and the second in the verticalplane to a mach number of 6.98 .  the test results showed that, althougha maximum mach number ofabout 6.5 was obtained, the flow in thetest section was not sufficientlyuniform for quantitative wind-tunnel testpurposes .  deviations from thedesign flow were traced to the presenceof a thick boundary layer whichdeveloped in the first step along theparallel walls .
