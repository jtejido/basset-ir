a simplified method of elastic stability analysis forthin cylindrical shells ..Abatdorf,s.b..Bi. donnell's equation.  naca tn.1341, 1947..Wa simplified method of elastic stability analysis forthin cylindrical shells .  the equation for the equilibrium of cylindricalshells introduced by donnell in naca report no. 479 tofind the critical stresses of cylinders in torsion isapplied to find critical stresses for cylinders withsimply supported edges under other loading conditions .it is shown that by this method solutions may be obtainedvery easily and the results in each case may be expressedin terms of two nondimensional parameters, one dependenton the critical stress and the other essentiallydetermined by the geometry of the cylinder .  the influence ofboundary conditions related to edge displacements in theshell median surface is discussed .  the accuracy of thesolutions found is established by comparing them withprevious theoretical solutions and with test results .  the solutions to a number of problems concerned withbuckling of cylinders with simply supported edges on thebasis of a unified viewpoint are presented in a convenientform for practical use .
