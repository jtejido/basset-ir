the calculation of lateral stability derivatives ofslender wings at incidence including fin effectiveness,and correlation with experiment ..Aross,a.j..Brae r.aero.2647, 1961..Wthe calculation of lateral stability derivatives ofslender wings at incidence including fin effectiveness,and correlation with experiment .  comparisons are made betweenlow-speed experimental results andestimates based on attached-flowtheory for the lateral stabilityderivatives of slender wings atincidence, and it is found that the flowseparation has little effect onthe sideslip derivatives .  the reductionin due to part-span anhedralis evaluated, and a semi-empirical formulais derived to account for importantsecond-order terms .  for the rotaryderivatives, an attempt is madeto estimate the effect of the leading edgevortices, but no satisfactoryconclusions have been reached .  the fin contributions tothe derivatives are evaluated on the basisof treating the wing surface asa total reflection plate .  good agreementwith experiment is reached forthe sideslip derivatives, and for thedamping-in-yaw at moderate incidences .sidewash is found to have a largeeffect on the rolling derivatives,and further information on the strengthand position of the leading edgevortices in non-symmetric flow is requiredbefore a complete calculation ofthe sidewash can be given .
