thermal distributions in jeffrey-hamel flows between nonparallel planewalls ..Amillsaps, k. and pohlhausen, k..Bj. aero. sc. v. 20. march 1953, pp 187-196 ..Wthermal distributions in jeffrey-hamel flows between nonparallel planewalls .the authors give the exact solution for the thermal distributions forthe steady laminar flow of a viscous incompressible fluid betweennon-parallel plane walls held at a constant temperature . the velocityprofiles are determined with the aid of jacobian elliptic functions byusing the jeffery-hamel solution of the hydrodynamic problem . it isshown that in this special case the energy equation giving thetemperature profiles can be reduced to an ordinary linear differentialequation with variable coefficients . after the introduction ofdimensionless parameters, numerical solutions are given for diverging andconverging channels with total openings of 10degree for the possiblecombinations of three reynolds numbers and five prandtl numbers .
