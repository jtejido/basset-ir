a simplified approximate method for the calculation of the pressurearound conical bodies of arbitrary shape in supersonic and hypersonicflow ..Awilli f. jacobs.Blockheed aircraft corporation, georgia division.Wa simplified approximate method for the calculation of the pressurearound conical bodies of arbitrary shape in supersonic and hypersonicflow .exact conical-flow solutions are available only for circular cones atzero angle of attack .  for nonaxisymmetric cones or cones at angle ofattack, only approximate methods exist .  these methods are generallyquite complicated and further limited to certain body shapes or certainmach-number ranges .  a great need was therefore felt for a simpleapproximate method applicable to any arbitrarily shaped conical body atzero incidence as well as at angle of attack .such a method has been developed recently at lockheed and is presentedhere in abbreviated form .  the method is based on the /equivalent-cone/theory .  this theory determines the pressure on a conical bodyutilizing information for a symmetric cone at zero angle of attack with thesame normal component of the free stream with respect to the surface asthe local element of the body considered .  this method works relativelywell at high mach numbers .  however, it is quite inconsistent at lowermach numbers, especially for bodies which deviate considerably fromcircular cones .  the equivalent-cone method does not give satisfactoryresults, mainly due to the fact that it considers only the local surfaceelement on the body independent of the other body elements in thenewtonian-theory manner .
