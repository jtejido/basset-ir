motions of a short 10degree blunted cone entering a martian atmosphereat arbitrary angles of attack and arbitrary pitching rates ..Apeterson, v.l..Bnasa tn-d 1326 ..Wmotions of a short 10degree blunted cone entering a martian atmosphereat arbitrary angles of attack and arbitrary pitching rates .the dynamic behavior of two probe vehicles entering a martian atmosphere in a passive manner with arbitrary initial angles of attack andpitching rates to 12degree per second has been determined . results for anentry velocity of 21,700 feet per second and an entry angle of -40degree were obtained from machine calculated solutions of the six-degree-of-freedom rigid-body equations of motion using experimental aerodynamiccharacteristics for the vehicles . one of the vehicles had a flat baseand was statically stable in two attitudes /nose forward and baseforward/ . the other vehicle, derived from the first by adding a conicalafterbody, was statically stable in only one attitude /nose forward/ .a 10-rpm vehicle spin rate, believed ample for the purpose ofdistributing solar and aerodynamic heating over the vehicle surface, and model atmospheres encompassing the probable extremes for the planetwere also considered .it was found that while the motion of the flat-based vehicle could beoscillatory about either the nose-forward or base-forward stable trimattitudes when aerodynamic heating rates were high, the range of initial angles of attack resulting in base-forward orientation was reduced bymore than a factor of 3. when initial pitch rates were increased frombody having only nose-forward stability showed that oscillatory anglesof attack at maximum heating-rate conditions probably would not exceedabout 25degrees although angles of attack when heating rates were 50percent of maximum could be as high as 40degree . values of these upperbound angles of attack were essentially independent of initial pitchrates for the range considered . furthermore, the envelope of maximumprobable angles of attack was increased only slightly when the vehiclewas given a 10-rpm spin rate . the relationship between maximumamplitudes of oscillation and heating rates through high heating portions ofthe trajectories was preserved when model atmospheres believed toencompass the extreme possibilities for mars were used in the calculations
