aerodynamic noise in supersonic wind tunnels ..Alaufer, j..Bj. aero. sc. v. 28, sept. 1961 ..Waerodynamic noise in supersonic wind tunnels .hot-wire measurements in the free stream of a supersonic wind tunnelwere made in the mach number range of 1.6 to 5.0 . it is shown that themass-flow fluctuations increase very rapidly with increasing machnumber . if the fluctuation field is assumed to consist of sound waves-dashan assumption that is consistent with the measurements-dashthe soundintensity is approximately proportional to m, within the range of theexperiments . furthermore, the orientation of the field is found to bedifferent from the mach line direction,. it corresponds to asound-source velocity of approximately one-half the free-stream velocity forthe higher mach numbers . it is shown that the turbulent boundary layeralong the nozzle and the tunnel walls is responsible for this soundfield .
