the injection of air into the dissociated hypersonic laminar boundarylayer ..Asinclaire m. scala.Bresearch engineermissile and ordnance systems department, general electric company,philadelphia, pa..Wthe injection of air into the dissociated hypersonic laminar boundarylayer .in first approximation, dissociated air may be treated as a binarymixture of air atoms and air molecules .  in order to include theeffects of mass transfer into the boundary layer, it becomes necessaryto introduce a third chemical species and hence a second diffusionequation .  we have avoided this complexity by considering the injectionof air molecules into the boundary layer, and hence the theoreticaltreatment is accomplished within the framework of a binary mixture gas .
