calculation of derivatives for a cropped delta wingwith subsonic leading edges oscillating in a supersonicairstream ..Awatson,j..Barc r + m 3060, 1958..Wcalculation of derivatives for a cropped delta wingwith subsonic leading edges oscillating in a supersonicairstream .  the lift, pitching moment and full-spanconstant-chord control hinge-moment are derived for a croppeddelta wing describing harmonic plunging and pitchingoscillations of small amplitude and low-frequency parameter ina supersonic air stream .  it is assumed that (a) the winghas subsonic leading edges, (b) the wing is sufficiently thinand the mach number sufficiently supersonic to permit theuse of linearised theory .  expressions for the various derivative coefficients areobtained for a particular delta wing of aspect ratio 1.8 andtaper ratio these are avaluated and tabulated for machnumbers 1.1, 1.15, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.944 .
