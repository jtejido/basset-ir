a simplified method of elastic stability analysis forthin cylindrical shells ..Abatdorf,s.b..Bnaca r.874, 1947..Wa simplified method of elastic stability analysis forthin cylindrical shells .  this paper develops a new method for determining the bucklingstresses of cylindrical shells under various loading conditions .for convenience of exposition, it is divided into two parts .  in part 1, the equation for the equilibrium of cylindricalshells introduced by donnell in naca report no. 479 to findthe critical stresses of cylinders in torsion is applied to findcritical stresses for cylinders with simply supported edges underother loading conditions .  it is shown that by this methodsolutions may be obtained very easily and the results in each case maybe expressed in terms of two nondimensional parameters, onedependent on the critical stress and the other essentiallydetermined by the geometry of the cylinder .  the influence of boundaryconditions related to edge displacements in the shell mediansurface is discussed .  the accuracy of the solutions found isestablished by comparing them with previous theoretical solutionsand with test results .  the solutions to a number of problemsconcerned with buckling of cylinders with simply supportededges on the basis of a unified viewpoint are presented in aconvenient form for practical use .  in part 2, a modified form of donnell's equation for theequilibrium of thin cylindrical shells is derived which isequivalent to donnell's equation but has certain advantages in physicalinterpretation and in ease of solution, particularly in the caseof shells having clamped edges .  the solution of this modifiedequation by means of trigonometric series and its application toa number of problems concerned with the shear buckling stressesof cylindrical shells are discussed .  the question of implicitboundary conditions also is considered .
