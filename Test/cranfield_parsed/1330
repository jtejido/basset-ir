on some fourier transforms in the theory of non-stationaryflows ..Agarrick,i.e..Bproc. 5th int. cong. app. mech. 1938, j. wiley, 590..Won some fourier transforms in the theory of non-stationaryflows .  the growth of lift on a airfoilstarting impulsively from rest to a uniformvelocity has been given by wagner (1925) .  thesteady-state lift due to circulation on anairfoil oscillating sinusoidally and moving withuniform velocity has been given by theodorsen  the present paper based essentially on thematerial of n. a. c. a. report no. 629 by theauthor, discusses some reciprocal relations ofthe nature of fourier transforms existingbetween the functions of wagner and theodorsen .kussner (1936) has already shown that wagner'sfunction may be derived from theodorsen'sfunction .  by means of a superposition principle itis possible to utilize these fundamentalfunctions to treat general problems in transientexpression which is accurate to within 2percent is given for wagner's function .  thisexpression leads to a good approximate expressionfor theodorsen's function in terms of theexponential integral, instead of hankel functions .an analogy is drawn between transienthydrodynamic flows and transient electrical flows .  kussner (1936) has introduced a functiondescribing the growth of lift on an airfoilentering a sharp edged vertical gust region .  thisfunction bears a certain relation to wagner'sfunction which is briefly discussed .
