formulae for use with the fatigue load meter in theassessment of wing fatigue life ..Aphillips,j..Brae tn. struct.279, 1960..Wformulae for use with the fatigue load meter in theassessment of wing fatigue life .  this note gives a method for the derivation of suitable constantswhich, when multiplied by the readings recorded at each appropriateacceleration level on a fatigue load meter and then added together, givedirectly the proportion of fatigue life used up in the wing .  it issuggested that when the estimated proportion is of order 80, then a moredetailed assessment of fatigue life should be made .
