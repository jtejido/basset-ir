turbulent boundary layer in compressible fluids ..Avan driest,e.r..Bj.ae.scs. 18, 1951, 145..Wturbulent boundary layer in compressible fluids .  the continuity, momentum, and energy differential equationsfor turbulent flow of a compressible fluid are derived, and theapparent turbulent stresses and dissipation function areidentified .  a general formula for skin friction, including heattransfer to a flat plate, is developed for a thin turbulent boundarylayer in compressible fluids with zero pressure gradient .  curvesare presented giving skin-friction coefficients and heat-transfercoefficients for air for various wall-to-free-stream temperatureratios and free-stream mach numbers .  in the special case when the boundary layer is insulated, thisgeneral formula yields skin-friction coefficients higher than thosegiven by the von karman wall-property compressible-fluidformula but lower than those given by the von karmanincompressible-fluid formula .  heat transfer from the boundary layerto the plate generally increases the friction and heat-transfercoefficients .
