hypersonic viscous flow over a flat plate ..Alees, l. and probstein, r. f..Bprinceton univ. aero eng. r195, 1952(abstract by e.m.keen).Whypersonic viscous flow over a flat plate .     in dealing with the steady laminar viscous flow over asemi-infinite flat plate some of the following topics are discussed .the streamline in the boundary layer over a leading edge of giventhickness . the rate of growth of the boundary layer in the main stream, andcauses of pressure variations .asymptotic solutions for thn downstream flow region, including thejoining interaction of shock waves at the leading edge .pressure variations in the interanl viscous flow layer and in externalinviscid flow considered as prandtl meyer flow . in cases of streamlinedeflection, the free stream mach number, zero pressure gradient, andsurface pressure distribution . asymptotic solutions for cases offluid injection of a cool gas . prandtl heat transfer . the joininginteraction between the external inviscid flow and the internal viscousflow layer . steady laminar hpyersonic viscous flow over a flat wedgeand a cone .
