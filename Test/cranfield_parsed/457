on laminar boundary-layer flow near a position of separation ..Agoldstein,s..Bq. j. mech.app. mech. 1, 1948, 43..Won laminar boundary-layer flow near a position of separation .  singularities are considered in the solution ofthe laminar boundary-layerequations at a position of separation .  a singularity ofthe type here considered occurredin a careful numerical computation by hartreefor a linearly decreasing velocitydistribution outside the boundary layer ,. it mayoccur generally .  whenever it doesoccur, the boundary-layer equations cease to bevalid at and near separation on theupstream side, and also downstream of separation .the work suggests thatsingularities may arise in the solution of non-linearparabolic equations due to theirnon-linearity .  the formulae found may helpcomputers of laminar boundary layers,who desire more than a rough solution, to havean end-point at which to aim .
