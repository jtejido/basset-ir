an experimental study of the effect of downwash froma twin-propeller vtol aircraft on several types ofground surfaces ..Ao'bryan,t.c..Bnasa tn.d1239, 1962..Wan experimental study of the effect of downwash froma twin-propeller vtol aircraft on several types ofground surfaces .  a full-scale, twin-propellervtol aircraft with a maximum grossweight of 3,400 pounds has beenoperated on the ground to study theeffect of downwash on several typesof ground surfaces .  static operation over loose snowindicated a zone of obliteratedvision ahead of the pilot in an arc ofapproximately 10 on each sideof the plane of symmetry .  an arc 10to 45 each side of the centerline was found to be an area of fairvisibility while the arc from 45to 90 was an area of poor visibility .  static operation in the presenceof loose surface materialindicated that the downwash cleared thearea near the aircraft of theseparticles without recirculation ordamage to any components .  short-time operation at moderateforward speed over loose gravel,with the thrust axis at an angle ofin propeller-blade erosion and numeroussmall dents and fabricpunctures in the sides of the fuselage .the propeller-blade erosion wassuperficial except for the leadingedges where several layers of glassfiber were eroded .
