equations, tables and charts for compressible flow ..Aames research staff..Bnaca r.1135, 1953..Wequations, tables and charts for compressible flow .  this report, which is a revision and extension of naca tnuseful in the analysis of high-speed flow of a compressible fluid .the equations provide relations for continuous one-dimensionalflow, normal and oblique shock waves, and prandtl-meyerexpansions for both perfect and imperfect gases .  the tablespresent useful dimensionless ratios for continuous one-dimensional flow and for normal shock waves as functions of machnumber for air considered as a perfect gas .  one series of chartspresents the characteristics of the flow of air (considered a perfectgas) for oblique shock waves and for cones in a supersonic airstream .  a second series shows the effects of caloricimperfections on continuous one-dimensional flow and on the flowthrough normal and oblique shock waves .
