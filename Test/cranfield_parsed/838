bending and compression tests of pressurised ring-stiffenedcylinders ..Adow,m.b. and peterson,j.p..Bnasa tn.d360, 1960..Wbending and compression tests of pressurised ring-stiffenedcylinders .  the results of tests on pressurized ring-stiffened cylinderssubjected to compression and bending are presented and discussed .  theresults obtained at high values of internal pressure differ from thoseobtained by previous investigators in that the theoreticalsmall-deflection compressive buckling coefficient of 0.6 was nearly achievedin each test .  small amounts of internal pressure had a greaterstabilizing effect in the bending tests than in the compression tests .
