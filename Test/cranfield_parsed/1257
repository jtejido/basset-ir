an optical boundary-layer probe ..Adaiber,j.w..Bj. ae. scs. 1960..Wan optical boundary-layer probe .  the applicability of the schlieren-photomultiplier technique toobtain quantitative density measurements in the laminarboundary layer induced by a traveling shock wave in a shock tube isinvestigated .  tests were conducted at a mach number of 1.58so that the data could be compared with the exact theoreticalsolution tabulated by mirels .  the data obtained are in goodagreement with the theory if the distance of the light beam abovethe floor of the shock tube is adjusted to fit the theoretical curve,.this would not be necessary if a larger shock tube were used .values of the transition reynolds number were also determinedwhich are slightly less than those found by martin using aninterferometer .  it is shown that this technique is sensitive enoughto detect changes in density that are only 0.000 per cent ofatmospheric density .
