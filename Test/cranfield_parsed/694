pressure distribution induced on a flat plate by a supersonic and sonicjet exhaust at a free-stream mach number of 1.80 ..Aleiss, a. and bressette, w.e..Bnaca rm l56106, 1957 ..Wpressure distribution induced on a flat plate by a supersonic and sonicjet exhaust at a free-stream mach number of 1.80 .as a continuation of previous research at mach numbers of 2.02 and 1.39, an experimental investigation was made of the pressures induced on aflat plate by a propulsive jet exhausting from sonic and supersonicnozzles at a free-stream mach number of 1.80 . measurements of thepressure distribution on a flat-plate wing were made at zero angle ofattack for four different locations of the jet exhaust nozzle beneaththe wing . both a choked convergent nozzle and a convergent-divergentnozzle on the nacelle were used . the nozzles were operated atnacelle-exit total-pressure ratios from 2 to 16 and the reynolds number per foot was approximately 13 x 10 .two distinct shock waves impinged on the wing surface and greatlyaltered the pressure distribution at all nozzle positions . positiveincremental normal force resulted on the wing at all positions .comparisons are presented for two free-stream mach numbers .
