a note on the explosion solution of sedov with applicationto the newtonian theory of unsteady hypersonic flow ..Afreeman,n.c..Bj. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 77..Wa note on the explosion solution of sedov with applicationto the newtonian theory of unsteady hypersonic flow .an exact analytical solution of the equations of inviscidcompressible unsteady flow has been given by sedov (referenceto the solution may be made through hayes and probstein) .this solution is the similarity solution for a constant-energy pointexplosion .  in view of the recent work on problems of hypersonicflow in the limiting form of the ratio of specific heats near 1solution in this limit and inquire what form such a solution wouldtake .  einbinder, in a recent note, has examined the solution forvarious but does not mention the interesting case of .it may be shown that the convergence to the limit is nonuniformover the flow field .  it is also not difficult to show that the non-uniform behavior exhibited here is that which one would expectfrom the newtonian formulation as derived in reference 3 .
