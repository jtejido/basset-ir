on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel ..Aholder, d.w. and schultz, d.l..Barc r + m 3265, august 1960 ..Won the flow in a reflected shock tunnel .the performance of a shock tunnel operated by the reflected-shocktechnique is examined theoretically neglecting viscous effects andhigh-temperature real-gas effects . particular attention is given todisturbances to the flow at the nozzle entry caused by waves reflected from the contact surface when the operating conditions depart from those forthat the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is weakenough to be tolerated only within a small range of primary-shock machnumber, m /e.g., 5 7 m 6 3 if the pressure at entry to the nozzle is toremain constant to 10 per cent/ . within this range, running times muchlonger than those obtained in 'straight-through' shock tunnels arepredicted, the limitation usually being imposed by the arrival of theexpansion wave originating at the diaphragm .outside this range of mach number, the uniform-flow duration between the arrival at the nozzle entry of the primary shock and the firstdisturbance reflected from the contact surface is shown to be approximately equal to the time between the arrival of the primary shock and thecontact surface in a 'straight-through' shock tunnel . at first sight it appears, therefore, that the advantages of reflected-shock operationare confined to a very narrow range of shock mach number, unless aheated driver gas is used in order to vary the mach number forfurther analysis suggests, however, that subsequent disturbances in themultiple wave reflection process between the contact surface and the end of the tube are relatively weak over a useful range of shock machnumber . thus, if the flow after the arrival of the early reflecteddisturbances is used for test purposes, long running times seem possible in theory without severe restrictions to the shock mach number .experiments have been made in a shock tube and a shock tunnel toprovide data for comparisons with the results of the simple theory . ifallowance is made for viscous effects on the motion of the contactsurface, fair agreement is found for the disturbances reflected andtransmitted by the contact surface, and for the arrival of the expansion wavereflection process increases when the shock mach number is raisedsubstantially above the 'tailored' value, and a limit to the usable flowduration may result .a striking feature of the results is a fall of pressure at the end ofthe tube immediately after reflection of the primary shock . this isattributed to attenuation of the reflected shock resulting from itsinteraction with the boundary layer on the wall of the tube . furtherresearch is required to check this explanation, and to investigate theeffects of reynolds number and of the cross-sectional shape and size ofthe tube . the effects of the tail and reflected head of the expansionwave originating at the main diaphragm are discussed . it is shown thatthe arrival of the reflected head at the nozzle entry may impose asevere limitation to the duration of uniform conditions at low shockmach number, and that the arrival of the tail may limit the flowduration at high shock mach number . unless means can be devised tosuppress the expansion wave, it is demonstrated that it is desirable tohave alternative diaphragm positions in a tube required to operate overa range of shock mach number .it is concluded that running times of order 10 milliseconds at a shockmach number of 4, falling to, perhaps, 1 millisecond at a shock machnumber of 8 seem possible in a shock tunnel of reasonable size by usingreflected-shock operation with unheated hydrogen driving air . becauseof the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical investigations, andthe deficiencies of the apparatus used for the experiments, the presentinvestigation must, however, be regarded as preliminary in character .further research is required to check and extend the findings, andtopics particularly requiring investigation are listed in the paper .
