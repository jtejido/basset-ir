an approach to the flutter problem in real fluids ..Arott,n. and george,m.b.t..Binst. aero. scs. perp.509, 1955..Wan approach to the flutter problem in real fluids .  an approximate theory of airfoils in unsteady motion in a viscousfluid is proposed, in which viscous effects are accounted for byrelaxing the kutta condition and replacing it by a relation derived fromexperiments in steady flow .  applications here, are limited to moderateviscous effects below the stall .  the possibility of one-degree-of-freedom flutter is discussed under this assumption .  the discussion ispartly extrapolated to the domain of stall flutter .  some possibilitiesof further development of this theory for the stalled case areindicated .
