a theoretical calculation of the laminar boundary layeraround an elliptic cylinder and its comparison withexperiment ..Amillikan,c.b..Bj. ae. scs. 3, 1936, 91..Wa theoretical calculation of the laminar boundary layeraround an elliptic cylinder and its comparison withexperiment .the author, in conjunction with th. von karman,has recently given a new method of approximateintegration of the prandtl boundary layer equations,which was developed in order to treat cases in whichseparation of a laminar boundary layer might beexpected .  the method was developed because some doubtwas felt as to the accuracy with which the well-knownpohlhausen analysis would describe conditions in theneighborhood of such a separation point .  numericalcalculations were carried out for certain cases involvingtheoretical simplifications, and very considerablediscrepancies were found between the results of the newand pohlhausen methods .  the method was also usedin developing a theory for the maximum lift coefficientof certain classes of airfoils .  this theory gavesatisfactory agreement with experiment but no directexperimental check on the boundary layer analysis itself hasbeen given up to the present .
