some features of supersonic and hypersonic flow aboutblunted cones ..Atraugott,s.c..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 389..Wsome features of supersonic and hypersonic flow aboutblunted cones .  for a family of cones of various semiapex angles blunted byspherical caps, shock shapes and surface pressure distributionshave been obtained from both the belotserkovskii method andexperiment .  these results are used to study convergence toconical flow .  conditions leading to both overexpansion andunderexpansion on the surface with respect to the asymptoticconical pressures are described as well as conditions leading tobow shock inflection points .  conditions also exist for which asecond shock may occur, or for which the sonic line cannot touchthe body surface .  the implications of these conditions forvarious blunt-body methods are discussed .  for cones bluntedin such a manner as to keep the flow entirely supersonic, the flowfield is found to exhibit certain similarities with that for genuineblunting .  this is related to the fact that the surface entropylayer for blunt bodies can be most influential, in determiningsurface pressure, in the interior of the flow field rather than nearthe surface .
