the effect of lift on entry corridor depth and guidancerequirements for the return lunar flight ..Awong,t. and slye,r..Bnasa r-80, 1960..Wthe effect of lift on entry corridor depth and guidancerequirements for the return lunar flight .  corridors for manned vehicles aredefined consistent with requirementsfor avoiding radiation exposure and forlimiting values of peakdeceleration .  use of lift increases the depthof the entry corridor .  mid-courseguidance requirements appear to be criticalonly for the flight-path angle .increasing the energy of the transfer orbitincreases the required guidanceaccuracy for the flight-path angle .  corrective thrust applied essentiallyparallel to the local horizontalproduces the maximum change in perigeealtitude for a given increment ofvelocity .  energy required to effect agiven change in perigee altitudevaries inversely with range measuredfrom the center of the earth .
