on local flat plate similarity in the hypersonic boundarylayer ..Amoore,f.k..Bj. ae. scs. 28, 1961..Won local flat plate similarity in the hypersonic boundarylayer .  a study is made of lees' /local flat-plate similarity/ rule forthe hypersonic laminar boundary layer .  it is shown that thisrule is exact under assumptions commonly invoked in theinviscid theory of hypersonic flow .  beginning from this theoretical basis, a modified localflat-plate similarity scheme is derived, involving separate rules forvelocity and enthalpy profiles, and is compared with exactsimilarity solutions and with the existing theory of hypersonicleading-edge interaction .
