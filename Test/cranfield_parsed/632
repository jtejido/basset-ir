calculated lift distributions in incompressible flowon some sweptback wings ..Abagley,j.a. and joyce,g.m..Brae tn. aero.2836, 1962..Wcalculated lift distributions in incompressible flowon some sweptback wings .  in the course of a larger survey of some aerodynamic characteristicsof a family of sweptback wings, the low-speed lift distributions werecalculated .  the 35 planforms considered cover a range of leading-edgesweep angles from 55 to 70, and aspect ratios from 2 to 3.9 .  theresults are given here, together with a comparison with othercalculations and with experimental results on one particular wing .
