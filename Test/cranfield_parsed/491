on the close relationship between turbulent plane-couetteand pressure flows ..Aburton,r.a..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 1004..Won the close relationship between turbulent plane-couetteand pressure flows .  author studies the velocity profiles measured by others in planeand turbulent couette flow, such as is induced in parallelchannels of which one of the walls moves in its own plane .  he findsthese profiles to be satisfactorily describable in terms of theseventh-power law, which was originally set up for plane andturbulent pressure flow in channels where both walls are stationary .further, he finds the shear law for pressure flow,to be applicable also to the couette flow, in a similar range ofreynolds number, r .  no attempt is made in this concisecontribution to put these findings on a firmer basis through a theoreticalexplanation .
