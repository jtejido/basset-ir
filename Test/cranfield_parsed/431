free-flight measurements of the zero-lift drag andbase pressure on a wind tunnel interference model (m=0 .8 - 1. 5) ..Agreenwood,g.h..Brae tn.aero.2725, 1960..Wfree-flight measurements of the zero-lift drag andbase pressure on a wind tunnel interference model (m=0 .8 - 1. 5) .  five free-flight models were flown to measure the zero-lift drag andbody base pressure on a standard wind tunnel interference model over amach number range of 0.84 to 1.48 .  roughness bands on the wings and body of the model are shown toproduce a small but definite increase in the zero-lift drag at all machnumbers .  the measured drag is in fair agreement with corresponding measurementsmade in various transonic tunnels with differences that could plausiblybe explained as the effects of tunnel interference .  the effect of a simulated wind tunnel support sting is shown toincrease the base pressure .  the discrepancy between models with andwithout a sting is greatest at subsonic speeds and progressivelydecreases with increasing mach number until at m = 1.4 the sting has noeffect on base pressure .
