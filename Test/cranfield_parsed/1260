on the response of the laminar boundary layer to smallfluctuations of the free-stream velocity ..Arott,n. and rosenzweig,m.l..Bj. ae. scs. 1960, 741..Won the response of the laminar boundary layer to smallfluctuations of the free-stream velocity .  the linearized treatment of small time-dependent disturbancesof a laminar boundary layer, initiated by lighthill, is extended inseveral ways .  in particular, the high-frequency expansion iscontinued beyond the leading (stokes) term .  several interestingquestions of /joining/ occur, which are discussed but leftunresolved .  in addition, a practical method for obtaining theresponse to the laminar boundary layer to an impulsive change invelocity is presented .  the methods are applied to the case inwhich the basic steady flow belongs to the falkner and skanfamily of similarity solutions .
