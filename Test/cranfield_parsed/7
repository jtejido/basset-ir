the effect of controlled three-dimensional roughnesson boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds ..Avan driest,e.r. and mccauley,w.d..Bj. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 261..Wthe effect of controlled three-dimensional roughnesson boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds .  experiments were performed in the 12-in. supersonic windtunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the californiainstitute of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensionalroughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on atained at local mach numbers of 1.90, 2.71, and 3.67 by varyingtrip size, position, spacing, and reynolds number per inch .the results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulentflow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements beginswhen the double row of spiral vortices trailing each elementcontaminates and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2)transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent withincreasing roughness height relative to the boundary-layerthickness, (3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strengthof the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of theensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements haslittle effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of thelaminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number where uand v are the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge ofthe boundary layer and k is roughness height, such that transitionoccurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynoldsnumber to the one-fourth power, viz., where x istrip position .
