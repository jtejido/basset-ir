flow past slender blunt bodies - a review and extension ..Acapiaux,r. and karchmar,l..Bpaper 61-201-1904, nat. ias-ars joint meeting, 1961..Wflow past slender blunt bodies - a review and extension .  a numerical solution of the inviscid flow field about slender bluntbodies of revolution has been developed through a combination of twomethods ..  the van dyke solution in the subsonic flowregion at the nose, and the method ofcharacteristics in the supersonic region .the results are compared withsecond-order blast wave theory and with experimentaldata,. and the respective merits anddeficiencies of the two theoretical methodsare pointed out .  the results of thenumerical solution are further used in adiscussion of the entropy layer, topropose a possible criterion of entropy layer thickness .
