an investigation of the pressure distribution on conical bodies inhypersonic flows ..Avictor zakkay.Baerodynamics laboratory, polytechnic institute of brooklyn, freeport,n.y..Wan investigation of the pressure distribution on conical bodies inhypersonic flows .a large amount of work on conical flow fields without axial symmetryat supersonic speed is presently available .  however, no apparenthypersonic approximation has yet been derived .  in this note,experimental data on two elliptical cones at m = 6 are presented and ahypersonic approach obtained from physical considerations is suggested .
