calculation of flutter characteristics for finite-span swept or unsweptwings at subsonic and supersonic speeds by a modified strip analysis ..Ayates, e.c..Bnaca rm l57l10, 1958 ..Wcalculation of flutter characteristics for finite-span swept or unsweptwings at subsonic and supersonic speeds by a modified strip analysis .a method has been developed for calculating flutter characteristics offinite-span swept or unswept wings at subsonic and supersonic speeds .the method is basically a rayleigh type analysis and is illustrated with uncoupled vibration modes although coupled modes can be used . theaerodynamic loadings are based on distributions of section lift-curveslope and local aerodynamic center calculated from three-dimensionalsteady-flow theory . these distributions are used in conjunction withthe /effective/ angle-of-attack distribution resulting from each of theassumed vibration modes in order to obtain values of section lift andpitching moment . circulation functions modified on the basis ofloadings for two-dimensional airfoils oscillating in a compressible flow are employed to account for the effects of oscillatory motion on themagnitudes and phase angles of the lift and moment vectors .flutter characteristics have been calculated by this method for 12 wings of varying sweep angle, aspect ratio, taper ratio, and center-of-gravity position at mach numbers from 0 to as high as 1.75 . comparisons of the results with experimental flutter data indicate that this method gives generally good flutter results for a broad range of wings .
