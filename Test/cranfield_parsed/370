theoretical pressure distribution on a hemisphere-cylindercombination ..Aanthony casaccio.Bresearch assistant, aerodynamics laboratory, polytechnic instituteof brooklyn, freeport, n.y..Wtheoretical pressure distribution on a hemisphere-cylindercombination .in recent years great use has been made of approximate methods forthe determination of the pressure distribution on blunt-nosed bodiesand afterbodies at high mach numbers .  for quasi-spherical bodiesit has been suggested that modified newtonian theory in combinationwith a prandtl-meyer expansion be used on the nose portion, the twolaws being matched at the point where the pressure gradients are equal .no simple approximation, however, has been found for flat-nosed bodies .as for the pressure distribution on the afterbody, the blast-waveanalogy has been suggested for general nose shapes but particularafterbody profiles .the purpose of the present note is to compare these approximateestimates with a more accurate determination of the flow field abouta hemisphere-cylinder in an ideal gas flow .  it was felt that sinceexperimental investigations in air at this mach number are scarceand very difficult to obtain, the comparison would be of interest .  thebasis of comparison is the flow field as it results from a numericalintegration of the exact equations governing the motion of the idealfluid .
