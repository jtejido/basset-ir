the 7 in. x 7 in. hypersonic wind tunnel at r.a.e. farnboroughpart ii. heater performance ..Aj. f. w. crane.B.Wthe 7 in. x 7 in. hypersonic wind tunnel at r.a.e. farnboroughpart ii. heater performance .tests on the storage heater, which is cylindrical in form and mountedhorizontally, show that its performance is adequate for operationat m=6.8 and probably adequate for flows at m=8.2 with the existingnozzles .  in its present state, the maximum design temperature of 680degrees centigrade for operation at m=9 cannot be realised in the tunnelbecause of heat loss to the outlet attachments of the heater andquick-acting valve which form, in effect, a large heat sink .  because of thisheat loss there is rather poor response of stagnation temperaturein the working section at the start of a run .  it is hoped to cure thisby preheating the heater outlet cone and the quick-acting valve .at pressures greater than about 100 p.s.i.g. free convection through thefibrous thermal insulation surrounding the heated core causes the topof the heater shell to become somewhat hotter than the bottom, whichresults in /hogging/ distortion of the shell .  this free convectioncools the heater core and a vertical temperature gradient is set upacross it after only a few minutes at high pressure .modifications to be incorporated in the heater to improve itsperformance are described .
