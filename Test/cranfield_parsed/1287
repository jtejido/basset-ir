progress report on an experiment on the effect of surfaceflexibility on the stability of laminar flow ..Agregory,n. and love,e.m..Barc cp.602, 1961..Wprogress report on an experiment on the effect of surfaceflexibility on the stability of laminar flow .  this paper describes the flexiblesurfaces whose properties havebeen examined and which have been tested onan aerofoil in a wind tunnel .the experiment has been rather inconclusiveas no drag reductions have beenfound in turbulent flow, whilst the onlyrearward movements of transitionoccurred in conditions where the alterationhas been inhibited by the onsetof laminar separation .  the limitations ofthe experiment are discussedcarefully in order to clarify the next stepswhich are to be taken withmore flexible surfaces with less damping .
