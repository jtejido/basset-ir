a characteristic type of instability in the large deflectionsof elastic plates ..Aashwell,d.g..Bproc. roy. soc. a, 214, 1952, 98..Wa characteristic type of instability in the large deflectionsof elastic plates .  part 1. from a general equation governingthe bending of thin elastic plates into certaintypes of surfaces of revolution are derivedexpressions for the behaviour of rectangular plateswith initial curvatures, subjected to purebending about one axis .  it is found that suchplates exhibit the type of instability characteristicof thin-walled structures which dependfor their stiffness on curvature .  curves aredrawn showing the deformation suffered bysuch plates, and an expression for the criticalbending moment at which instability occurs isobtained .  experimental results show satisfactoryagreement .  part 2. the analysis of part 1 is extended to dealwith the case of flat square or rectangularplates loaded by distributed bending momentsapplied to all four edges .  curves are drawnto describe their behaviour, and they are foundto exhibit the characteristic instabilitydisplayed by thin-walled curved structures .experimental verification is satisfactory .
