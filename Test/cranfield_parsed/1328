the production of aerodynamic forces by heat additionon external surfaces of aircraft ..Awillmarth,w.w..Brand corp. rm.2078, 1957..Wthe production of aerodynamic forces by heat additionon external surfaces of aircraft .  within the framework of linearizedflow theory an equivalence betweena fluid mass source, a heat source,and streamwise body forces isdeveloped .  the equivalence betweenthe fluid mass source and heatsource was first noticed by hicks(2)and later by chu .  (3) using theequivalence the flow field producedby heat addition and bymagnetohydrodynamical body forces can be computed .  examples for a two-dimensionalflat plate, a delta wing, an axiallysymmetric slender body, and a wedge-shapedafterbody are computed atsubsonic and supersonic speeds .the efficiency of lift or thrustproduction by surface heat addition isvery low at subsonic speeds .  atsupersonic speeds the efficiency iscompared with the efficiency of aconventional turbojet-powered aircraftconfiguration .  it is found thatthe efficiency of lift or thrust productionby heat addition ontwo-dimensional bodies is approximately the sameas that for aturbojet-powered two-dimensional body .  theefficiency is somewhat higher at lowsupersonic mach numbers and behavesas, decreasing to aconstant value as increases .on the other hand, the efficiency ofthrust production by heat additionincreases linearly with mach numberwhen heat is added on the rear surfaceof an axially symmetric afterbodyof parabolic shape .
