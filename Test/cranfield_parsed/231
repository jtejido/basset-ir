practical calculation of second-order supersonic flowpast non-lifting bodies of revolution ..Avan dyke,m.d..Bnaca tn.2744..Wpractical calculation of second-order supersonic flowpast non-lifting bodies of revolution .  calculation of second-order supersonic flow past bodies ofrevolution at zero angle of attack is described in detail, and reduced toroutine computation .  use of an approximate tangency condition is shownto increase the accuracy for bodies with corners .  tables of basicfunctions and standard computing forms are presented .  the procedure issummarized so that one can apply it without necessarily understandingthe details of the theory .  a sample calculation is given, and severalexamples are compared with solutions calculated by the method ofcharacteristics .
