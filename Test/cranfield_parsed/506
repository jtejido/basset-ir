a note on havelock's shallow-water wave-resistancecurves ..Abrandmaier,h.e..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 257..Wa note on havelock's shallow-water wave-resistancecurves .in the continuous quest for improved means oftransportation, attention is currently focused on the ground-effectmachine .  as there is no physical contact between the vehicleand the terrain over which it operates, its performance shouldbe similar over land and water .  however, over water there isan additional resistance to motion due to the gravity-wavesystem generated by the supporting or /cushion/ pressure actingon the water surface .  estimates of this component can be madeusing the analysis of t. h. havelock .  it is the purpose of thisnote to present an ibm 650 digital-computer solution of hisequations .  as shown below, these results differ from havelock'soriginal results .
