a note on the numerical solution of fourth order differentialequations ..Awoods,l.c..Baero. quart. 5, 1954, 176..Wa note on the numerical solution of fourth order differentialequations .  an old numerical methodof solving fourth order differential equationsis put in relaxation form .  the higherorder correction terms are included and thetechnique is illustrated by an example .the method has the advantage of being morerapidly convergent than the usual relaxationprocedure for fourth order equations .some comments are made on the numericalsolution of the viscous flow equation .
