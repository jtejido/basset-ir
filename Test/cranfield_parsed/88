magnetohydrodynamic free-convection pipe flow ..Acramer,k.r..Bj. ae. scs. 28, 1961, 736..Wmagnetohydrodynamic free-convection pipe flow .it has been shown that transverse magnetic fields of practicalstrengths exert considerable influence on liquid-metal,free-convection, vertical, flat-plate and parallel-plate flow fields .the extent of influence was determined by the magnitude of anondimensional parameter a which is the ratio of the hartmannnumber to the fourth root of the grashof number, and is ameasure of the relative influence of the magnetic and buoyantforces .  in this note the steady, fully developed, laminar,free-convection flow of a fluid of electrical conductivity througha fully submerged, open-ended, constant-temperature, verticalpipe located in a transverse magnetic field of strength isanalyzed in terms of the same parameter .  the magnitude ofits influence on the velocity and temperature profiles, the surfaceshear and heat transfer, and the volumetric flow rate isdetermined .
