heat transfer through the laminar boundary layer ona circular cylinder in axial incompressible flow ..Abourne,d.e. and davies,d.r..Bq. j. mech. app. math. 11, 1958, 52..Wheat transfer through the laminar boundary layer ona circular cylinder in axial incompressible flow .  this paper presents a method of calculatingthe distribution of rate of heat transferinto a laminar incompressible boundary layerfrom the exterior surface of a long thincircular cylinder, when the surface of thecylinder is maintained at a constanttemperature and the flow is parallel to thecylinder axis,. the temperature differencebetween the surface and the main streamis taken to be small enough to neglectbuoyancy effects .  a series solution, validfor small downstream distances from thenose, has been obtained already by seban,bond, and kelly .  this is now extendedby deriving an asymptotic series solution,valid at large downstream distances, andbridging the gap between these two seriessolutions by an approximate solution,based on the method used recently by daviesand bourne to calculate heat transferfrom a flat plate .  the calculation is used todemonstrate the effect of curvatureand of prandtl number on the local rate of heattransfer at various downstreamdistances by comparing with the corresponding flat plate results .
