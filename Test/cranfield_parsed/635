heat transfer and pressure distributions on a hemisphere-cylinder and abluff-afterbody modelin methane-air combustion products and in air ..Airving weinstein.Bnational aeronautics and space administration .technical note d-1503.Wheat transfer and pressure distributions on a hemisphere-cylinder and abluff-afterbody modelin methane-air combustion products and in air .an experimental investigation has been made to indicate the validity ofusing methane-air combustion products as the test medium for aerodynamicheating and loading tests .  tests were conducted on ahemisphere-cylinder and on a bluff-afterbody model, both in methane-air combustionproducts and in air alone, and covered a range of mach numbers from 6 tothe data showed that the nondimensional heating-rate distributionalong a hemisphere-cylinder as obtained in combustion products was ingood agreement with that obtained in air, and the results were inreasonable agreement with theory .  the stagnation-point heating ratesin air and in combustion products over the hemisphere-cylinder agreedwithin 10 percent of the theoretical values .  the pressuredistributions around a hemisphere-cylinder obtained from tests in combutionproducts were in good agreement with those obtained in air and couldbe predicted by newtonian flow theory .  the tests in combustionproducts of a bluff-afterbody model produced nondimensionalheat-transfer coefficients which were in fair agreement with resultsobtained in air .
