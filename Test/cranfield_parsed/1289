(a) spanwise distribution ofsection lift coefficient, (b) totallift coefficient, and (c) total pitching-momentcoefficient .  in addition,generalized gust forces on approximate fundamentalcantilever bending modes (parabolic) are also included .  results have beenobtained for 60 and 75 delta wings,ratio 11.60, and an unswept wing of aspectratio 6.00 .  conditions for whichcalculations were made include two mach numbersreduced-frequency range of 0 to 1.0 .  thedirect gust forces and moments are informs suitable to be inserted in equationsof motion used in the calculation ofthe dynamic responses of flexible liftingvehicles to random turbulence and to becompared with results from other methods .
