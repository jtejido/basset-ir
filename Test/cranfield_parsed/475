the velocity distribution in the laminar boundary layerbetween parallel streams ..Alock,r.c..Bq. j. mech. app. math. 4, 1951, 42..Wthe velocity distribution in the laminar boundary layerbetween parallel streams .  a method is given for obtaining the solution of the laminar boundarylayer equations for the steady flow of a stream of viscousincompressible fluid over a parallel stream of different density andviscosity .  an approximate solution is also obtained by means of themomentum equation .  it is shown that the solutions depend only on theratio of the velocities of the two streams and on the product of thecorresponding density and viscosity ratios .  numerical results aregiven, in the case where the lower fluid is at rest, for four values ofand also when for one non-zero value of the velocity ratio .
