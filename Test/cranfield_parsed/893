a new design of pitot-static tube with a discussionof pitot-static tubes and their calibration factors ..Asalter,c..Bnpl. aero. r.1013, 1962..Wa new design of pitot-static tube with a discussionof pitot-static tubes and their calibration factors .  the report describes experiments devised to investigatesome of the previously unexplained peculiarities of normal types ofpitot-static tube .  in the process use was made of what was as nearlyas could be a standard static pressure tube .  the experiments led to a new alternative design of instrumenthaving a nose of modified ellipsoidal shape and for which the maincharacteristics have been investigated .  it has been found to be necessary as well as desirable toinclude a discussion of the implications of the term /calibrationfactor/ and (although not in this respect comprehensive) of the specialfeatures and limitations of various pitot-static tubes .
