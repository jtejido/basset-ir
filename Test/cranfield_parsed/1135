limit analysis of symmetrically loaded thin shellsof revolution ..Adrucker,d.c. and shield,r.t..Bj. app. mech. 26, 1959, 61..Wlimit analysis of symmetrically loaded thin shellsof revolution .the yield surface for a thin cylindrical shellis shown to be a very good approximation tothe yield surface for any symmetricallyloaded thin shell of revolution .  hexagonalprism approximations to this yield surface,appropriate for pressure vessel analysis, aredescribed and discussed in terms of limitanalysis .  procedures suitable for findingupper and lower bounds on the limit pressurefor the complete vessel are developed andevaluated .  they are applied for illustrationto a portion of a toroidal zone or knuckle heldrigidly at the two bounding planes .  thecombined end force and moment which can becarried by an unflanged cylinder also is discussed .
