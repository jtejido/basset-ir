laminar heat-transfer and pressure measurements over blunt-nosedcones at large angle of attack ..Avictor zakkay.Bresearch associate, polytechnic institute of brooklyn, freeport, n.y..Wlaminar heat-transfer and pressure measurements over blunt-nosedcones at large angle of attack .tests have been conducted at a mach number of 6, in the pibal hypersonicfacility, in order to determine the heat-transfer and pressuredistributions over a slender blunted cone at angles of attack oferature ratio, stagnation to wall, was approximately 2.3 .  the modeltested has a sperical nose diameter of 1.0 in., a base diameter of 3.75in., and a cone half-angle of 20 degrees .  the measurements were madeat 5 peripheral stations on the model .in this note the experimental results at a 15 degree angle of attackare presented .  a more detailed analysis of the results for allangles of attack is presented in reference 1 .
