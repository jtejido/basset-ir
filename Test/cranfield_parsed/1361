large deflections of structures subjected to heatingand external loads ..Aturner,j.m..Bj. ae. scs. 1960..Wlarge deflections of structures subjected to heatingand external loads .  the method of direct formulation of the stiffness matrix isextended to include the effects of nonuniform heating and largedeflections .  the purpose is to develop an analytical tool for thetreatment of actual structures .  in the solution of aeroelastic problems the relations betweenforces and deflections must be determined .  the usual stiffnessmatrix formulation of this relationship is limited to smalltemperature changes and small deflections .  for large temperaturechanges additional terms are required .  also the problembecomes geometrically nonlinear when large deflections areinvolved .  to overcome the inherent difficulties of the nonlinearproblem for practical structures either an iterative or a step-by-step procedure must be used .  the force-deformation relationsnecessary for this step-by-step or iterative approach are derivedfor an axially loaded member and for a plate element includingthe effects of thermal strains .
