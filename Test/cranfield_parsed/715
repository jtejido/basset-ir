motion of a ballistic missile angularly misalignedwith the flight path upon entering the atmosphere andits effect upon aerodynamic heating, aerodynamic loadsand miss distance ..Aallen,h.j..Bnaca tn.4048, 1957..Wmotion of a ballistic missile angularly misalignedwith the flight path upon entering the atmosphere andits effect upon aerodynamic heating, aerodynamic loadsand miss distance .  an analysis is given of theoscillating motion of a ballistic missilewhich upon entering the atmosphereis angularly misaligned with respectto the flight path .  the history ofthe motion for some example missilesis discussed from the point of viewof the effect of the motion on theaerodynamic heating and loading .the miss distance at the target due tomisalignment and to small accidentaltrim angles is treated .  thestability problem is also discussed forthe case where the missile istumbling prior to atmospheric entry .
