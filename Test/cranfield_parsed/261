experiments on axi-symmetric boundary layers alonga long cylinder in incompressible flow ..Ayashura,m..Btrans. japan soc.ae.sc. 2, 1959..Wexperiments on axi-symmetric boundary layers alonga long cylinder in incompressible flow .  experiments on axi-symmetric boundarylayers along a long cylinder were madeespecially to investigate the effect of transversecurvature on the velocity profile .  laminarvelocity profiles were measured and comparedwith theoretical ones with good accuracy .a representative profile was plotted to see theeffect of transverse curvature, which showedsmall, but obvious effect accompanied byincreasing skin friction .  the transition of the flow from laminar toturbulent was observed, and its reynoldsnumber was estimated to occur at 1.2 1.8x10in the present experiment .  the turbulentprofile was also measured and plotted by usingthe coordinates to express the wall lawdeduced by richmond, from which it wasestimated that, as the ratio of the momentumthickness to body radius increases, the profilenear the outer layer tends to bend downrelative to the line of logarithmic wall law .
