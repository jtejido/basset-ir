flutter analysis of circular panels ..Arattayya,j.v..Bj. ae. scs. 20, 1962, 534..Wflutter analysis of circular panels .  the flutter problem of flat circular panels with edges elasticallyrestrained against rotation has been formulated in terms ofsmall-deflection plate theory .  the panel is subjected to uniformall-round tension or compression in its middle plane, in addition tothe supersonic compressible flow passing over its upper surfacewith still air below .  linear piston theory is employed to predictthe aerodynamic load on the vibrating panel .  the problem is investigated by a rayleigh-type analysisinvolving chosen modes of the panel as degrees of freedom .  in order to investigate the convergence of the solution, theflutter-mode shape of the clamped-edge panel has been expressedin a series form in powers of r cos o .  the results of three-, four-,and five-term approximations have displayed oscillatorybehavior with apparently rapid convergence of the solution .
