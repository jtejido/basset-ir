stability of the cylindrical shell of variable curvature ..Amarguerre,k..Bnaca tm.1302,1951..Wstability of the cylindrical shell of variable curvature .the report is a first attempt to devise a calculation methodfor representing the buckling behavior of cylindrical shellsof variable curvature .  the problem occurs, for instance, indimensioning wing noses, the stability behavior of which isdecisively influenced by the variability of curvature .  thecalculation is made possible by simplifying the stabilityequations (permissible for the shell of small curvature) andby assuming that the curvature as a function of the arclength s can be represented by a very few fourier terms .we evaluated the formulas for the special case of anellipse-like half oval with an axis ratio undercompression in longitudinal direction, shear, and a combination ofshear and compression .  however, the results can also beapplied approximately to an unsymmetrical oval-shell segmentunder compression, shear, and bending so that the numericalvalues contained in the diagrams 10 to 12 represent directlydimensioning data for the wing nose .
