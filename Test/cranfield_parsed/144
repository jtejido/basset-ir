heat flow in composite slabs ..Amayer,e..Bj.am.r.s. 22, 1952, 150..Wheat flow in composite slabs .  this paper presents the solution of the heat flowproblem in composite walls under heat transfer conditionswhich are typical of uncooled rocket engine walls .analytic expressions in the form of fourier sums are obtainedfor the temperature distribution in a composite wallconsisting of an inner (refractory) medium and an outermetallic) medium under newtonian heat transfer into thefirst medium with negligible heat transfer from thesecond medium to the exterior .  the expressions obtainedare based on a plane parallel composite slab as arepresentative model for relatively thin cylindrical walls, withthickness-to-radius ratio not exceeding 0.2 .  the generalresults for the composite slab are simplified for the limitingcases of a thin refractory shield with a thick shieldedmedium and a thick refractory shield with a thin shieldedmedium .
