estimation forces and moments due to rolling for severalslender tail configurations at supersonic speeds ..Abobbitt,p.j. and malvestuto,f.s..Bnaca tn.2955, 1953..Westimation forces and moments due to rolling for severalslender tail configurations at supersonic speeds .  the velocity potentials, span loadings, and corresponding forceand moment derivatives have been theoretically evaluated for a numberof slender-tail arrangements performing a steady rolling motion atsupersonic speeds .  the method of analysis is based upon an application ofconformal-transformation techniques .  the utilization of these techniques allowsthe simple determination of the complex potentials for various typesof two-dimensional boundary-value problems .  in addition, two simple and often-used approximations to therolling derivatives have been compared with the corresponding exactvalues determined by the method presented in this report .  in order to show the importance of wing-tail interference, theeffect of the flow field behind a rolling wing on the tailcharacteristics has been illustrated for a simple wing-tail arrangement .
