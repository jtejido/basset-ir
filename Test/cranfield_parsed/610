corner interference effects ..Agersten,k..Bagard r.299, 1959..Wcorner interference effects .  the three-dimensional incompressible flow of fluid along the corner oftwo semi-infinite plates intersecting at right angles, especially theinterference of the boundary layers of the two plates, is discussed .mainly, the more important case of turbulent boundary layer is treatedby means of experimental studies carried out at the technical universityof braunschweig .  some theoretical results for laminar flow are alsotaken into account .  in order to describe the interference effects in the boundary layer,an interference displacement thickness and an interference skin frictionhave been introduced .  it is shown from experiments and also fromtheoretical considerations how these two quantities depend on reynoldsnumber .  furthermore, the influence of interference on the transitionfrom laminar to turbulent flow is investigated .  in addition, somepreliminary results are given about the effect of the pressure gradienton the interference effects .
