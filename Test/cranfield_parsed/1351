exploratory tests of the effects of jet plumes on theflow over cone- cylinder flare bodies ..Afalanga,r.a..Bnasa tn.d1000, 1962..Wexploratory tests of the effects of jet plumes on theflow over cone- cylinder flare bodies .  schlieren photographs have beentaken of the flow overcone-cylinder-flare bodies to study theextent of boundary-layer separationdue to the presence of rocket jetplumes .  tests were made of threecone-cylinder-flare configurations inthe langley 11-inch hypersonic tunnel ata mach number of 9.65 and in thelangley unitary plan wind tunnel at amach number of 4.65 with twoadditional configurations .  the streamreynolds number varied fromapproximately 317,000 to 582,000 based onmodel length .  the conical flareshad half-angles of 7 or 13 andcontained one of two test nozzles witha design mach number of 3.72 or 4.53 .the test nozzles were operated withcompressed air and were designed tosimulate a solid-propellant rocketmotor operating at altitudes betweento free-stream static-pressure ratiovaried from jet off to 1,150 for thetest nozzle with a design machnumber of 3.72 and from jet off tomach number of 4.53 .  for most ofthe tests the angle-of-attack rangewas 0 to -4,. some additional testswere made at 2 and 4 .  measurements taken from flow picturesindicated that at zero angleof attack on all configurations testedwith jet on the boundary layerseparates ahead of the flare-cylinderjuncture and the separation pointmoves toward the cone-cylinder juncturewith an increase in pressureratio .  increasing angle of attackreduced the extent of boundary-layerseparation on the windward side asdid increasing the stream mach numberfrom 4.65 to 9.65 .  other parameterswhich tended to reduce the extentof boundary-layer separation were ..number, (b) decreasing stream reynoldsnumber, and (c) displacing nozzleexit rearward .
