on the vibration of thin cylindrical shells under internalpressure ..Afung,y.c., sechler,e.e. and kaplan,a..Bj. ae. scs. 27, 1957, 650..Won the vibration of thin cylindrical shells under internalpressure .  the frequency spectra and vibration modes of thin-walledcircular cylinders subjected to internal pressure are considered .it is shown that for very thin cylinders the internal pressurehas a significant effect on the natural vibration characteristics .for these cylinders, particularly those having smaller length todiameter ratios, the mode associated with the lowest frequencyis in general not the simplest mode .  the exact number ofcircumferential nodes, n, which occur in the mode associatedwith the lowest frequency, depends on the internal pressure p .if this number n is large, it decreases rapidly with increasing pwhen p is small, and the /fundamental/ frequency--the lowestfrequency at each p--increases rapidly with increasing internalpressure .  at higher values of internal pressure the frequencyspectrum tends to be arranged in the regular manner, thefrequency increases with the increasing number of circumferentialnodes, and the lowest frequency rises slowly with the internalpressure .  experimental results on the frequency spectra, vibrationmodes, and structural damping of a series of thin-walled cylinderssubjected to internal pressure are briefly described .  theseresults show agreement with the features predicted by reissner's  the effect of slight deviation of the cylinder from perfectcircular symmetry is discussed .
