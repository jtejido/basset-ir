reaction tests of turbine nozzles for supersonic velocities ..Akeenan,j.h..Basme trans. 1949, 773..Wreaction tests of turbine nozzles for supersonic velocities .  a machine for testing turbine nozzles by the reactionmethod, which was described in a previous paper, wasused to test a series of convergent-divergent turbinenozzles .  the results of these tests, along with the testof a convergent turbine nozzle, are compared with eachother and with analytical values .  two kinds of analyticalvalues are employed, namely, the usual values obtainedfrom an assumed isentropic expansion from inlet state toexhaust pressure, and the values obtained from theassumption that the processes in the nozzle are isentropicexcept for a normal shock which takes up a position in thenozzle such as to cause the stream to fill the exit area atthe exhaust pressure whenever possible .  this latter kindof analytical value involves no shock when the exit area canbe filled at the exhaust pressure by means of isentropicprocesses only, or when the exhaust pressure is loweredso far that the shock has passed out of the passage .  theagreement of the test results with the calculated resultsof this latter kind is good, and the disagreement whichexists can be attributed largely to separation at the shockand to transmission of exhaust-pressure effects upstreamthrough the boundary layer .
