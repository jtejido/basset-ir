separation, stability and other properties of compressiblelaminar boundary layer with pressure gradient and heattransfer ..Amorduchow,m. and grape,r.g..Bnaca tn.3296, 1955..Wseparation, stability and other properties of compressiblelaminar boundary layer with pressure gradient and heattransfer .  a theoretical study is made of the effect of pressure gradient,wall temperature, and mach number on laminar boundary-layercharacteristics and, in particular, on the skin-friction and heat-transfercoefficients, on the separation point in an adverse pressure gradient,on the wall temperature required for complete stabilization of thelaminar boundary layer, and on the minimum critical reynolds number forlaminar stability .  the prandtl number is assumed to be unity and thecoefficient of viscosity is assumed to be proportional to thetemperature, with a factor arising from the sutherland relation .  a simple andaccurate method of locating the separation point in a compressible flowwith heat transfer is developed .  numerical examples to illustrate theresults in detail are given throughout .
