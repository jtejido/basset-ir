real gas effects in flow over blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds ..Anagamatsu, h.t., geiger, r.e. and sheer, r.e..Bj. aero. sc. april, 1960. p241 ..Wreal gas effects in flow over blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds .a hypersonic shock tunnel has been developed to investigate theaerodynamic characteristics of flow over bodies at conditions comparable tothose encountered by ballistic missiles and satellites re-entering theatmosphere . some results for a shock velocity of over 50,000 ft. persec. in the shock tube portion of the facility are presented . staticpressure investigations were made in the nozzle to determine the flowcondition and the expansion process .the results of the investigation of representative blunt bodies athypersonic mach numbers and nozzle stagnation temperatures up toapproximately 6,000degreek. are presented . these include body pressuredistributions, shock-wave shapes, detachment distances, and photographsof the luminous gas region in the shock layer . it is seen that theshock detachment distance is smaller at higher stagnation temperaturesdue to the real gas effects . for the hemisphere the pressuredistribution was less than that predicted by the modified newtonian theory for all stagnation temperatures . for a 50degree cone-hemisphere thepressure distribution and the shock detachment distance were appreciablyaffected by the real gas effects .the observed shock-wave shape and the approximate boundary layer on aflat plate are compared with the analytical prediction . somepreliminary results for the detached shock wave produced by a blunt two-dimensional body in a low density flow at a mach number of 19.6 are presented
