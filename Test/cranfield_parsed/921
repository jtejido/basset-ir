slender-body theory-review and extension ..Aadams, m.c. and sears, w.r..Bj. aero. sc. v. 20, february 1953 ..Wslender-body theory-review and extension .the approximate theory of flow about slender bodies and wings originated by munk and jones is reviewed . it is presented here in a form thatemphasizes the relation to the source-sink methods of von karman andothers . the extension to noncircular bodies is made for subsonic flow,paralleling ward's extension for supersonic flow . the calculation ofpressures and forces and the extension of the theory to unsteady flowsare reviewed, and some discrepancies in the published literature areexplained .finally, interpreting the jones slender-wing result as the first term of an expansion in powers of a breadth parameter /e.g., aspect ratio/, itis shown how a more accurate theory can be developed by carryingadditional terms for both subsonic and supersonic speeds . this theory ofnot-so-slender wings is applied to some practical wing problems,including direct problems of flow past given wings and problems of wingdesign for minimum drag . the accuracy of the new results is assessed by comparison with linearized supersonic-airfoil theory for the specialcase of a flat delta wing .
