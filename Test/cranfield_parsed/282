jet effects on base pressure of conical afterbodiesat mach 1. 91 and 3. 12 ..Abaughman,l.e. and kochendorfer,f.d..Bnaca rm e57e06..Wjet effects on base pressure of conical afterbodiesat mach 1. 91 and 3. 12 .  data are presented which show the effect of a jet on base pressurefor a series of conical afterbody-jet-nozzle combinations havingboat-tail angles that varied from 0 to 11 and base-to-jet diameter ratiosthat varied from 1.11 to 2.67 .  the jet nozzles had exit angles from 0to 20 and were designed for exit mach numbers from 1.0 to 3.2 .pressure ratios up to 30 were tested for both a cold (air) and a hotnumbers of 1.91 and 3.12 .  in general, base pressure increased for increasing values ofboat-tail angle, nozzle angle, jet temperature, and jet total pressure andfor decreasing values of base-to-jet diameter ratio, jet mach number,and free-stream mach number .  the addition of tail surfaces producedonly small changes in base pressure .  for all variables, base pressure is governed by the maximumpressure rise that can be supported by the wake fluid in the region of thetrailing shock .  the wake pressure ratio is in turn governed by the jetand free-stream mach numbers adjacent to the wake region and by thestate of the boundary layer on the boattail and on the nozzle .  values of wake pressure ratio computed using the theory of korst,page, and childs were in good agreement with experimental values forconvergent nozzles .
