a rapid approximate method for the design of hub shroud profiles ofcentrifugal impellers of given blade shape ..Asmith, k.j. and hamrick, j.t..Bnaca tn 3399. 1955 ..Wa rapid approximate method for the design of hub shroud profiles ofcentrifugal impellers of given blade shape .a rapid approximate method for the design of centrifugal compressors ofgiven blade shape with compressible nonviscous flow characteristics hasbeen developed using techniques based upon stream-filament theory .axial symmetry is assumed, but meridional-plane forces derived fromtangential pressure gradients are included .the method was applied to the design of an impeller in order todetermine the approximate maximum meridional streamline spacing thatcould be used . three numerical solutions for different streamlinespacings were made using the same hub profile, blade shape, andprescribed velocity distribution along the hub . the shroud profilesobtained from the three solutions, which utilized 3, 5, and 9stream-tubes, were negligibly different . the approximate computing timerequired was 15 hours per streamtube .
