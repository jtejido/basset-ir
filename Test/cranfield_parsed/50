investigation of laminar boundary layer in compressiblefluids using the crocco method ..Avan driest,e.r..Bnaca tn.2597, 1952..Winvestigation of laminar boundary layer in compressiblefluids using the crocco method .  in the present investigation of the flow of air in a thin laminarboundary layer on a flat plate, the crocco method has been used to solvethe simultaneous differential equations of momentum and energy involvedin such flow .  the crocco method was used because it gave accurateresults for arbitrary prandtl number near unity .  the prandtl numberwas taken at 0.75, the specific heat was held constant, and thesutherland law of viscosity-temperature variation was assumed torepresent the viscosity data starting with an initial ambienttemperature of -67.6 f .  the main results presented here are theskin-friction and heat-transfer coefficients as functions of reynolds number,mach number, and wall-to-free-stream temperature ratio .  variations ofshear, velocity, temperature, and mach number across the boundary layerare included .  the crocco method is discussed in detail .
