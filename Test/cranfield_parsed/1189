nonequilibrium flow past a wedge ..Acapiaux,r. and washington,m..Baiaa jnl. 1963, 1, 650..Wnonequilibrium flow past a wedge .  an exact numerical solution is obtained forthe chemically reacting flow past a wedge .  thefreestream is either in equilibrium or out ofequilibrium but nonreacting .  the attachedshock wave is shown to be either concave, convex,or straight, depending on the values of theamount of dissociation in the freestream anda parameter describing the amount of energycontained in the freestream relative to the gasdissociation energy .  numerical examples arepresented illustrating these regimes .  the flowfield is characterized by the presence of anentropy layer and a relaxation layer, both easilyidentifiable in the presentation of the numericalresults .
