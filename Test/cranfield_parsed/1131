the effect of axial constraint on the instability ofthin conical shells under external pressure ..Asinger,j..Bj. app. mech. 29, 1962, 212..Wthe effect of axial constraint on the instability ofthin conical shells under external pressure .  author considers elastic axial restraint which may be (1)active from the beginning of loading and (2) active only at the onsetof buckling .  buckling loads for the two cases are related by asimple conversion factor .  effect of the restraint on theaxisymmetric type buckling is negligible, but the amplification of thecritical load for the nonaxisymmetric type buckling may be verylarge for type (1) restraint .  design curves are included for arange of l d.and restraint stiffness .  results are of doubtfulvalue considering the known inadequacy of the linear theory ofbuckling under axial compression .
