transition form laminar to turbulent shear flow ..Amorkovin,m.v..Basme trans, 80, 1958,1121..Wtransition form laminar to turbulent shear flow .  recent experimental studies of transition from laminar toturbulent shear flows are reviewed .  certain common featuresare emphasized and related to the stability theories of viscousshear layers .  the three-dimensional character, theunsteadiness, and the nonlinear and random behavior of the latter stagesof the transition process are also examined .
