three dimensional effects in viscous wakes ..Asteiger,m.h. and bloom,m.h..Baiaa jnl. 1963,776.Wthree dimensional effects in viscous wakes .  three-dimensionality in wakelike or jetlikefree mixing may stem from initial geometricconfigurations, nonuniformities in flow variablesover a cross section, or boundary conditionsalong the flow .  these may be generated bybodies at angle of attack, nonaxisymmetricbodies, mixing of nonaxisymmetric jets withan outer flow, finite wings, or more artificialmeans .  this paper is devoted to studies bearingon such configurations .  the first sectiondeals with the general mathematical model, inwhich the boundary layer approximationsare used, and with methods of solution .laminar and turbulent flow, compressibility,unsteadiness, and streamwise pressure gradientsare admitted initially .  the flux forms of theequations are given .  algebraic integrals of theenergy equations and the diffusion (frozen-flow) equations are obtained .  a simplificationof the convective terms, roughlycorresponding to the oseen approximation, is usedin the asymptotic downstream region .the second section contains explicit solutionsfor specific configurations, in particularfor flows whose initial isovels are of elliptic shape .these flows may be wakelike or jetlike .compressibility is admitted,. however, the flowsmust have uniform pressure and must besteady .  the final section deals with interpretationand evaluation of the results .
