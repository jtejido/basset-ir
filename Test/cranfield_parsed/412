critical combinations of shear and transverse directstress for an infinitely long flat plate withedges elastically restrained against rotation ..Abatdorf,s.b. and houbolt,j.c..B.Wcritical combinations of shear and transverse directstress for an infinitely long flat plate withedges elastically restrained against rotation .  an exact solution and a closely concurring approximateenergy solution are given for the buckling of an infinitely longflat plate under combined shear and transverse direct stresswith edges elastically restrained against rotation .  it was foundthat an appreciable fraction of the critical stress in pure shearmay be applied to the plate without any reduction in thetransverse compressive stress necessary to produce buckling .  aninteraction formula in general use was shown to be decidedlyconservative for the range in which it is supposed to apply .
