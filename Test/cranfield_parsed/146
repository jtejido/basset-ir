supersonic flow past slender bodies with discontinuousprofile slope ..Afraenkel and portnoy..Baero.quart. 6, 1955, 114..Wsupersonic flow past slender bodies with discontinuousprofile slope .  ward's slender-body theory is extended to derive firstapproximations to the external forces on slenderbodies of general cross sectionwith discontinuous profile slope .  twoclasses of body are considered ..bodies whose profile (typified by the localradius) is continuous between thenose and base, and certain bodies whoseprofile is discontinuous, such asbodies with annular or side air intakes andwing-bodies on which the winghas an unswept leading edge .  (where airintakes are concerned, it isassumed that they are sharp-edged and thatthere is no /spillage/ of theinternal flow) .  the following conclusions apply tothe former class of bodies .  thevariation of drag with mach number isfound to depend only on thediscontinuities in the longitudinal rate of changeof the cross-sectional area, and isthus independent of cross-sectional shape .the drag itself is unchanged ifthe direction of the flow is reversed .  theexpressions for lift and momentassume the same forms as for smooth pointedbodies, the lift depending onlyon conditions at the base of the body .  the general theory is applied towinged bodies of revolution with anunswept wing leading edge ..  the resultsbear a marked resemblance to thoseobtained by ward .  the results for wingsalone are seen to be applicable,with one modification, to subsonic as well as to supersonic speeds .
