a theoretical study of stagnation point ablation ..Aroberts, l..Bnasa tr r-9, 1959 ..Wa theoretical study of stagnation point ablation .a simplified analysis is made of the shielding mechanism which reducesthe stagnation-point heat transfer when ablation takes place at thesurface . the most significant result of the analysis is that theeffective heat capacity of the ablation material increases linearly with stream enthalpy . the automatic shielding mechanism is discussed andthe significant thermal properties of a good ablation material are givenparameters .
