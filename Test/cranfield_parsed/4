approximate solutions of the incompressible laminarboundary layer equations for a plate in shear flow ..Ayen,k.t..Bj. ae. scs. 22, 1955, 728..Wapproximate solutions of the incompressible laminarboundary layer equations for a plate in shear flow .  the two-dimensional steady boundary-layerproblem for a flat plate in ashear flow of incompressible fluid is considered .solutions for the boundary-layer thickness, skin friction, and the velocitydistribution in the boundarylayer are obtained by the karman-pohlhausentechnique .  comparison withthe boundary layer of a uniform flow has alsobeen made to show the effect ofvorticity .
