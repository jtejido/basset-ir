an approximate analytical method for studying entryinto planetary atmospheres ..Achapman,d.r..Bnasa r-11, 1959..Wan approximate analytical method for studying entryinto planetary atmospheres .  the pair of motion equations for entry into aplanetary atmosphere is reduced to a single, ordinary,nonlinear differential equation of second order bydisregarding two relatively small terms and byintroduring a certain mathematical transformation .  thereduced equation includes various terms, certain ofwhich represent the gravity force, the centrifugalacceleration, and the lift force .  if these particularterms are disregarded, the differential equation islinear and yields precisely the solution of allen andeggers applicable to ballistic entry at relatively steepangles of descent .  if all the other terms in the basicequation are disregarded (corresponding to negligiblevertical acceleration and negligible vertical componentof drag force), the resulting truncated differentialequation yields the solution of sanger for equilibriumflight of glide vehicles with relatively large lift-dragratios .  a number of solutions for lifting and nonliftingvehicles entering at various initial angles also havebeen obtained from the complete nonlinear equation .these solutions are universal in the sense that asingle solution determines the motion and heatingof a vehicle of arbitrary weight, dimensions, andshape entering an arbitrary planetary atmosphere .one solution is required for each lift-drag ratio .these solutions are used to study the deceleration,heating rate, and total heat absorbed for entry intovenus, earth, mars, and jupiter .  from theequations developed for heating rates, and fromavailable information on human tolerance limitsto acceleration stress, approximate conditions forminimizing the aerodynamic heating of a trimmedvehicle with constant lift-drag ratio are establishedfor several types of manned entry .  a brief studyis included of the process of atmosphere braking forslowing a vehicle from near escape velocity to nearsatellite velocity .
