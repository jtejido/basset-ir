the problem of strain accumulation under thermal cycling ..Ab. e. gatewood.Bresearch coordinator, air force institute of technology,wright-patterson air force base, ohio.Wthe problem of strain accumulation under thermal cycling .parkes and sprague and huang have shown that it is possible for straingrowth to occur in a beam structure under temperature-load cycling .the various aspects of this problem as to criteria for convergence anddivergence of the strain accumulation can be simply demonstrated bythermal cycling one element of a two-element structure .
