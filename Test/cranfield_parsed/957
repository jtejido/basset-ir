axisymmetric snap buckling of conical shells ..Anewman,m. and reiss,e.l..Bnasa tn.d1510, 1962, 451..Waxisymmetric snap buckling of conical shells .  the authors give a brief accountof some of their recent analytical andnumerical studies of cone buckling,limiting the discussion to axisymmetricdeformations .  pertinent numerical results for therelaxation buckling of full conessubjected to uniform external pressure andbelleville springs deformed by axialedge loads are presented .  in addition,bifurcation buckling problems arediscussed .  for a specific case, the existenceof friedrichs' intermediate bucklingload, as applied to cones, is established .upper and lower bounds forits value are given .
