the influence of two-dimensional stream shear on airfoil maximum lift ..A.B.Wthe influence of two-dimensional stream shear on airfoil maximum lift .the cornell aeronautical laboratory is conducting a program oftheoretical and experimental research on low-speed aerodynamics asapplied to stol and vtol aircraft .  the objective of this program is tore-examine certain aspects of classical aerodynamic information, in thelight of low-speed flight requirements, with the aim of seekingaerodynamic processes which might be exploited to enhance law-speedperformance .one aspect of propeller-driven aircraft which has recently receivedincreasing attention is the existence of strong gradients oflongitudinal velocity, or shear, in the propeller slipstream .  thisslipstream shear interacts with a wing surface and can alter the wingcharacteristics .  in theoretical treatments of a wing interacting witha propeller slipstream, the first important simplification is thereplacement of the slipstream with an ideal uniformjet, free of all velocitygradients .  the application of these theories requires that one equatethe actual slipstream to an effective uniform jet .  one methodemployed is to assume the uniform jet has a momentum flux equal to theaverage in the propeller slipstream .  these and similar proceduresare well founded on momentum considerations., however, the implicitassumption is that the flow nonuniformity, the shear, does not influencethe wing characteristics .
