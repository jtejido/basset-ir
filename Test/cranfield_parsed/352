on heat transfer over a sweat-cooled surface in laminarcompressible flow with a pressure gradient ..Amurduchow,m..Bj. ae. scs. 19, 1952, 705..Won heat transfer over a sweat-cooled surface in laminarcompressible flow with a pressure gradient .  a simple expression is derived for the normal injection velocitydistribution theoretically required to maintain a given uniformtemperature along a porous surface in the laminarboundary-layer region of a compressible flow with a given velocitydistribution outside of the boundary layer .  this expression is valid forany given free-stream mach number but is based on a prandtlnumber of unity and on the assumption that the viscositycoefficient varies linearly with the temperature .  by using thedorodnitsyn type of transformation, the variation of fluidproperties even in the case of zero mach number is taken intoaccount .  this study is of particular practical interest inconnection with the sweat-cooling of turbine blades and of airfoil surfacesin high speed flow .  the method of analysis consists of applyingthe karman-pohlhausen method to both the momentum andenergy boundary-layer equations and of using an additional heatbalance equation, involving the coolant temperature .  aclosed-form approximate solution of the equations is then derived .numerical examples for flow in the immediate vicinity of astagnation point and for a typical type of flow over a turbine blade aregiven .
