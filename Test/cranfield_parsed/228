navier-stokes solutions at large distances from a finite body ..Ai-dee chang.B.Wnavier-stokes solutions at large distances from a finite body .this paper is concerned with a theoretical investigation of the flowfield at large distances from an object moving through a viscous fluid .the discussion will be restricted to the case of two-dimensionalstationary incompressible flow .  the object will be assumed to be offinite size .  the domain of the fluid is infinite and it is assumedthat there are no other boundaries for the fluid except that of thegiven object .  the reynolds number will be assumed to have a fixedvalue., thus we shall not consider the limiting cases of the reynoldsnumber tending to zero or to infinity .
