shock wave effects on the laminar skin friction ofan insulated flat plate at hypersonic speeds ..Ali,t.y. and nagamatsu,h.t..Bj. ae. scs. 20, 1953, 345..Wshock wave effects on the laminar skin friction ofan insulated flat plate at hypersonic speeds .  an approximate theory on the phenomena of interactionbetween the shock wave and the laminar boundary layer on aninsulated flat plate at hypersonic speeds has been formulated .results on the rate of growth of the boundary-layer thickness andthe rate of decay of the shock-wave strength have been foundthat hold for .  a new set of formulasfor the average skin-friction coefficient, over an insulatedflat plate at hypersonic speeds has been obtained .  calculationson the basis of the new formulas yield the data shown in figs.steady decrease in as increases, the present results indicatethat may increase with at hypersonic machnumbers .
