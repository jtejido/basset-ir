turbulent skin friction at high mach numbers and reynoldsnumbers in air and helium . nasa r82, 1960 ..Amatting,f.w., chapman,d.r., nyholm,j.r. and thomas,a.g..Bnaca r847, 1946..Wturbulent skin friction at high mach numbers and reynoldsnumbers in air and helium . nasa r82, 1960 .  results are given of local skin-friction measurements in turbulentboundary layers over an equivalent air mach number range from 0.2 to 9.9and an over-all reynolds number variation of 2x10 to 100x10 .  directforce measurements were made by means of a floating element .  flowswere two-dimensional over a smooth flat surface with essentially zeropressure gradient and with adiabatic conditions at the wall .  air andhelium were used as working fluids .  an equivalence parameter forcomparing boundary layers in different working fluids is derived andthe experimental verification of the parameter is demonstrated .experimental results are compared with the results obtained by severalmethods of calculating skin friction in the turbulent boundary layer .
