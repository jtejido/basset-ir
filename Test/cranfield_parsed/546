measurements of aerodynamic heating on a 15 cone ofgraded wall thickness at a mach number of 6. 8..Awoodley,j.g..Brae tn.aero.2847, 1962..Wmeasurements of aerodynamic heating on a 15 cone ofgraded wall thickness at a mach number of 6. 8.  this note describes transient walltemperature measurements made on ain an airstream of mach number 6.8 .  the skin of the model wassufficiently thin to allow it to reach zeroheat transfer conditions within arunning time of one minute .  in order to reduce effectsof longitudinal heat conduction during arun the electroformed-nickel skinof the model was made with gradedthickness, and as a result fairlyuniform temperature distributions alongthe surface were obtained at alltimes in both the laminar and turbulentregions .  values of heat transfer, calculated from the wall temperature-timehistories using the thin-walltemperature are compared to theoreticalestimates using the intermediateenthalpy method 10, 11 .
