wall interference at transonic speeds on a hemisphere cylinder model ..Arogers, e.w.e. and hall, i.m..Ba.r.c., c.p. 510, september 1959 ..Wwall interference at transonic speeds on a hemisphere cylinder model .tests have been made in three n.p.l. wind tunnels on a pressure-plotting model consisting of a long cylinder with a hemispherical nose . thesurface pressure distributions were measured for stream mach numbersbetween 0.7 and 1.1 at zero model incidence, and schlieren photographswere taken . the blockage ratios were 0.211(, 0.117( and 0.120( .the principal feature of the flow is the effect of working section sizeon the rate at which the terminal shock wave moves back along the modelwith increasing stream mach number . this is thought to depend mainlyon the distance from the model to the slotted walls of the tunnel,and not necessarily on the blockage ratio . the distance of the solidsidewall is important in influencing the local mach number ahead of theterminal shock, by reflecting the expansion-wave system originating near the model nose .
