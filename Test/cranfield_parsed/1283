on shearing flow between porous coaxial cylinders ..Adunwoody,n.t..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 494..Won shearing flow between porous coaxial cylinders .  the flow between concentric porous cylinders in relative axialmotion with a pressure gradient is considered .  the analysis isrestricted by the assumption that the velocity distribution is afunction of the radial coordinate only so that there is no netinjection or withdrawal of fluid at any station .  this assumptionreduces the problem to a soluble system of ordinary differentialequations .  an associated heat-transfer problem is also discussedbriefly .
