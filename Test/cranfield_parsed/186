base pressure in supersonic flow ..Agadd,g.e., holder,d.w. and regan,j.d..Barc cp271, 1956..Wbase pressure in supersonic flow .  the problem of accurately predicting the pressure and wakeconfiguration at the base of bodies in supersonic flow is anextremely important one inasmuch as a sizeable portion of the totaldrag of a given body may be attributable to the low pressure inthis region .  although a great deal of theoretical and experimentalwork has been done in this field, there does not yet exist asatisfactory method for accurate predictions .  this paper represents an excellent effort to experimentallyconfirm analytically deduced concepts .  a large amount ofexperimental data on body shapes such as wedges, cones, andcone-cylinders has been obtained over a range of mach numbers up to 4 .the data are thoroughly discussed with respect to analyticaldeductions .  on the basis of the evidence accumulated it isconcluded that the boundary-layer thickness has only a small effecton the base pressure for axisymmetric bodies and fortwo-dimensional bodies when the base height-to-chord ratios are ofthe order .  reviewer believes this report is a significant contribution in thefield of base pressure and wake flow phenomena .
