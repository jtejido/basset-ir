wing-tail interference as a cause of 'magnus' effectson a finned missile ..Abenton,e.r..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 1358..Wwing-tail interference as a cause of 'magnus' effectson a finned missile .  wing-tail interference is shown to cause large /magnus/ effectson a finned missile whose wings are deflected into an aileronsetting .  a simple experimental method with water as theworking medium is used to obtain low-speed magnus data on a rollingmissile .  the missile is a slender cruciform configuration withall-movable wings and fixed tail fins .  magnus data arepresented for angles of attack up to 15 and for the one (high) rollrate which accompanies a 30 aileron deflection angle of thewings .  tests conducted at zero roll rate but with the wingdeflection maintained, revealed large forces in the magnus direction,thereby providing the basis for understanding magnus effects dueto wing-tail interference .  a semiempirical theory is proposed to explain the experimentaldata .  a simplified model of the wake behind the wings isintroduced to predict tail-interference factors .  good agreement withthe data is obtained .  this magnus effect is opposite in direction to the classicalmagnus lift on a spinning cylinder ,. it is much larger than eitherthat effect or the one on a missile with only one set of fins .wing-tail interference is the predominant source of the effect ,. roll rateonly modifies the basic interference mechanism .
