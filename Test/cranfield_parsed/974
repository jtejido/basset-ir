approximate analysis of thrust vector control by fluid injection ..Awu, j.m., chapkis, r.l. and mager, a..Bars journal, 1677-1685, 1961 ..Wapproximate analysis of thrust vector control by fluid injection .a study has been made of the side force generated by injection ofsecondary material into the main stream of a rocket nozzle . two caseshave been analyzed .. gas injection and liquid injection . for the gasinjection case, it is assumed that the turbulent boundary layer ahead of the injection point separates from the wall . the pressure in theseparated region and the extent of the separated region are determinedby a consideration of turbulent boundary layer-shock wave interactionand the accommodation height of the injected gas stream . equations arederived for calculating the side force, and the side forces predicted by the theory are compared with experimental data . the agreement betweentheory and experiment is fair . for the case of liquid injection, it isassumed that the liquid flows along the nozzle wall and evaporates intothe main stream . the resulting side force on the nozzle wall isdetermined on the basis of linearized theory, thus restricting the analysisto small rates of liquid injection . the effects of small rates of heataddition are also included in the analysis . a very simple equation forcalculating the side force is obtained .
