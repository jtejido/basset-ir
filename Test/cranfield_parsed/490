normal-shock relations in magnetohydrodynamics ..Agundersen,r.m..Bj.ae.scs.29, 1962, 997..Wnormal-shock relations in magnetohydrodynamics .  the magnetic-field vector is perpendicular to the flow direction,.thus for normal shocks there is no change of flow direction throughthe shock front .  this class of shocks is included ininvestigations by several authors (five are referred to here), but thepresentation here is thought to be especially convenient .  alldownstream quantities are given in terms of upstream flow conditions,including the upstream ratio of alfven speed to sound speed, andthe shock strength (density ratio) .
