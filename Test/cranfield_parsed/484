the influence of two-dimensional stream shear for airfoilmaximum lift ..Avidal,r.j..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 889..Wthe influence of two-dimensional stream shear for airfoilmaximum lift .  the effects of stream velocity gradients on airfoil maximumlift are defined with experimental data obtained in a simulatedtwo-dimensional slipstream .  the experimental results showthat when positioned near the slipstream plane of symmetry, theairfoil maximum lift varies markedly with location in theslipstream .  in moving the airfoil from above to below theslipstream plane of symmetry through a total distance correspondingto the airfoil thickness, force data and boundary-layerobservations show that boundary-layer separation is delayed to higherangles of attack, and the airfoil maximum lift is doubled .  it is concluded that the destalling effect observed in thenon-uniform slipstream is not associated with slipstream boundaryinterference, but stems from the influence of the large localslipstream shear on airfoil characteristics .  the effects of uniformand nonuniform shear on airfoil lift and pressure distribution arediscussed, within the framework of existing first-order,small-shear theory, to show that these effects of shear tend to promotestall .  a pohlhausen calculation of the laminar boundary layerin a stream with shear is used to identify and to assess the effectsof stream shear on boundary-layer separation criteria .  it isdemonstrated that these effects are negligibly small, and that theuniform-flow criterion applies .  it is concluded on the basis ofthe experimental data that the observed destalling phenomenonstems from a shear effect of higher order than those treated in theinviscid theories .  it is hypothesized that it is a second-ordereffect, fixed by the product of the stream shear and the derivativeof the shear, which was large in the present experiments .
