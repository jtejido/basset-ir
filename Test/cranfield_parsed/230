interference between the wings and tail plane of aslender wing-body tailplane combination ..Aowen,p.r. and maskell,e.c..Brae r.aero.2441, 1951..Winterference between the wings and tail plane of aslender wing-body tailplane combination .  an approximate method of predicting the interference betweenthe wings and the tailplane of a slender wing-body-tailplanecombination in an inviscid flow is developed, in order to explain the changein centre of pressure position with incidence which has been found tooccur in wind tunnel and flight tests on guided weapons .  incidencechanges in one plane only, normal to the plane containing the wingsand the tail surfaces, have been considered .  the method is based on slender body theory and the assumptionthat the wing trailing vortices roll-up completely before they reachthe tailplane,. it is, therefore, applicable to weapons equipped withlow aspect ratio wings far separated from the tail surfaces .  whenthe tail surfaces are triangular and of low aspect ratio, ananalytical solution is given for the effect of the wing downwash field onthe tail lift .  for high aspect ratio, rectangular tail surfaces itis suggested by comparison with experimental data, that the tail liftmay be estimated approximately from the value of the mean downwashangle across the tail span .  a summary of the method is given in para.5 which, in conjunctionwith the introduction, may be read independently of the rest of thereport .
