on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells ..A.B.Won transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells .  a numerical analysis is given for the solution of thegeneral equations of thin shells of revolution subjected torotationally symmetric pressure and temperaturedistributions .  the basic differential equations are in a very generalform, which permits the geometry of the shells considered,to be specified by discrete data points .  the analysis determines elastic stresses, strains anddisplacements for multi-layer and multi-sectional shells ofrevolution .  surface loads, temperatures, thicknesses andmaterial properties may vary arbitrarily in the meridionaldirection .  temperatures and material properties can alsovary through the thickness .  the solution is obtained by direct computation using anumerical method that employs two by two coefficientmatrices,. and hence avoids the problems of slow convergence .the solution has been programmed in a semi-algebraiclanguage which can be used on most high speed computers .comparisons of numerical solutions to known exact andapproximate solutions of the thin shell equations are made todemonstrate the accuracy of this method .
