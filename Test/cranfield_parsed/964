on the theory of discharge coefficients for round entrance flowmetersand venturis ..Arivas, m.a. and shapiro, a.h..Btrans. a.s.m.e., v. 78, april 1956, pp 489-497 ..Won the theory of discharge coefficients for round entrance flowmetersand venturis .a theory of rounded-entrance flowmeters, based on a consideration of the potential and boundary-layer flows in a converging nozzle, isconstructed . curves are presented showing the discharge coefficient as afunction of diameter reynolds number, with the /total equivalent lengthtional length-diameter ratio of the contraction section of the asmelong-radius nozzle is presented . the theoretical curves of dischargecoefficient versus diameter reynolds number are in good agreement withexperiment over a range of reynolds number from 1 to 10  . the theoryprovides a rational framework for correlating and extrapolatingexperimental results,. it shows the effects of contraction shape andlocation of pressure taps,. it furnishes values of discharge coefficient for untested designs,. and it suggests precautions to be taken indesign, installation, and operation .
