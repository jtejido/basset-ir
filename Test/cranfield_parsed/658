review of panel flutter and effects of aerodynamic noisepart i..  panel flutter ..Al. e. goodman and j. v. rattayya.Buniversity of minnesota, minneapolis, minnesota.Wreview of panel flutter and effects of aerodynamic noisepart i..  panel flutter .with the development of high-speed aircraft and missiles, vibrationof panels has become a problem of practical significance .  manyof the failures of the early german rockets after attaining supersonicspeed have been attributed to the development of such paneloscillations .  it appears thisphenomenon is not of much concern in the subsonicspeed range., however, in the supersonic speed range panels may developoscillations which cause instability of the structure .  this effect hasbeen exhibited experimentally under controlled laboratory conditionsmotion is limited and buckling may not be a serious design problem .in these cases panel flutter is still of importance because of itseffect on the fatigue life and the allowable stresses for design ofthe panel material .the oscillations of panels may be due either to aerodynamic forceinduced by the motion of the panel, or to aerodynamic noise, orbuffeting (irregular motion induced by turbulence in the flow) .the interaction between aerodynamic forces and panel motions, usuallyreferred to as /panel flutter,/ has been investigated by several workersin recent years .  since the problem is too complex to be dealt within its entirety, simplifying assumptions have been made in theseinvestigations .  the literature is marked by a certain degree ofcontroversy over the validity of these assumptions and the applicability ofthe results obtained .  a brief review of the literature with referenceto several of the approximations made and the results obtained follows .
