the calculation of aerodynamic loading on surfaces of any shape ..Afalkner, v.m..Br + m 1910, august 1943 ..Wthe calculation of aerodynamic loading on surfaces of any shape .the object of the report is to establish a routine method for thecalculation of aerodynamic loads on wings of arbitrary shape . the methoddeveloped is based on potential theory and uses a general mathematicalformula for continuous loading on a wing which is equivalent to a double fourier series with unknown coefficients . in order to evaluate theunknown coefficients the continuous loading is split up into a regularpattern of horseshoe vortices, the strengths of which are proportionalto the unknown coefficients and to standard factors which are given in a table . the total downwash at chosen pivotal points is obtained bysumming the downwashes due to the individual vortices, a process whichis simplified by the use of specially prepared tables of the propertiesof the horseshoe vortex . by equating the downwash to the slope of thewing at each pivotal point, simultaneous equations are obtained, thesolution of which defines the unknown coefficients .the first layout involves a total of 76 vortices over the wing, and asecond layout, involving a total of 84, is shown to be of superioraccuracy . the effect on the solution of the number of pivotal points is investigated and it is concluded that by a suitable choice, it isunnecessary to use a large number . results for a rectangular wing atwith those obtained by other workers and it appears that there may beerrors in published results in at least one of these cases . immediatedevelopment includes the application to the calculation of thecharacteristics of actual sweptback wings, including rotary derivatives, and future development includes also applications in wind tunnel design and technique .
