upper and lower bounds for the solution of the firstbiharmonic boundary value problem ..Adiaz,g.b., and greenberg,h.g..Bj. math. phys. 27, 1948, 193..Wupper and lower bounds for the solution of the firstbiharmonic boundary value problem .  let w(x,y) be a solution of the boundary value problemwhere r is a planedomain with the boundary c .  the authors obtain upper andlower bounds for, the value of w at a point in r,by a method which is applicable to many other problems .  if u is a function satisfying the boundary conditionsand v is a function satisfying the partial differentialequation, then the authors obtain by applying green'sclassical identity and schwarz's inequality a pair of inequalitiesof the form where .  together with the function w the authors consider afunction the solution of the boundary value problemon c, and inanalogy with the functions u and v associated with thefunction w a pair of functions and associated with thefunction .  in the expression for derived from green'sclassical identity appears an unknown line integralcontaining the values of w and on c .  but the same lineintegral appears also in the expressions forto which the above inequalities areapplicable .  in this way the authors obtain two inequalities of the formwhere b and b', respectively, are approximatevalues of .  in order to improve these boundsone may add to u a linear set of functions and to v alinear set of functions and then minimize h(u-v) in orderto determine the coefficients of the best linear combinations .if the sequences and are complete in a certain sensedefined by the authors the approximations will converge tothe value .
