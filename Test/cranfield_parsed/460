correlated incompressible and compressible boundarylayers ..Astewartson,k..Bproc. roy. soc. a, 200, 1949, 84..Wcorrelated incompressible and compressible boundarylayers .  the boundary-layer equations for a compressiblefluid are transformed into those for anincompressible fluid, assuming that the boundaryis thermally insulating, that the viscosity isproportional to the absolute temperature, andthat the prandtl number is unity .  variousresults in the theory of incompressible boundarylayers are then taken over into thecompressible theory .  in particular, the existence ofmethod for retarded flows is applied to determinethe point of separation for a uniformlyretarded main stream velocity .  a comparison withan exact solution is used to show that thismethod gives a closer approximation than does pohlhausen's .
