wake of a satellite traversing the ionosphere ..Arand,s..Bphys. fluids, 3, 1960..Wwake of a satellite traversing the ionosphere .  the particle treatment is applied to a study of thestructure of the wake behind a charged bodymoving supersonically through a low-density plasma .for the case of a body whose dimensions areconsiderably smaller than a debye length, a solution is obtainedwhich is very similar in structure to thesolution obtained by using the linearized fluid dynamics equation .for the case of a disk whose radialdimensions are much larger than a debye length, twoconical regions are found in the wake .  at thesurface of each of these cones, over thicknesses ofthe order of a debye length, the ion and electrondensities are increased over their ambient values .formulae for the electrohydrodynamic drag on awire, and on a large disk are obtained .
