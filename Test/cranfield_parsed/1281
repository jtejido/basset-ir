turbulent heat transfer on blunt-nosed bodies in two-dimensionaland general three-dimensional hypersonic flow ..Avaglio-laurin,r..Bj. ae. scs. 1960, 27..Wturbulent heat transfer on blunt-nosed bodies in two-dimensionaland general three-dimensional hypersonic flow .  recent results obtained for three-dimensional laminarboundary layers are extended to the turbulent case .  it is shown thatin the presence of highly cooled surfaces and of moderate machnumbers of the outer stream, the crossflow and the pertainingreynolds stresses in a general three-dimensional turbulentboundary layer are negligible even for large transverse pressuregradients .  a correlation due to mager between two-dimensional compressible and incompressible turbulent boundarylayers is extended to the problem in question .  from a study ofthe transformation and of its implications, a rapid method forthe analysis of the boundary-layer flow under the subjectconditions is established .  in the absence of general three-dimensional data, a comparison with experiments and with thepredictions of other known analyses is carried out for severalaxisymmetric configurations,. the results of the method presentedhere exhibit good agreement with the data .  the range ofvalidity of the cold wall approximation for general three-dimensionalproblems is estimated qualitatively on the basis of recentmeasurements in laminar flow, the argument being that, for eitherzero or favorable streamwise pressure gradients, smallerthree-dimensional effects are to be expected in a turbulent boundarylayer, as compared to a laminar layer .
