effects of surface tension and viscosity on taylorinstability ..Abellman,r. and pennington,r.h..Bq. app. math. 12, 1954..Weffects of surface tension and viscosity on taylorinstability .  the model used is that of twofluids of infinite depth, with the interfaceinitially in the form of a sine wave withamplitude small compared to wave length .the fluids are considered incompressible,and only the linear terms in the equations ofhydrodynamics are used .  the first foursections discuss the effects of surface tensionand viscosity .  the fifth gives a few numericalresults to illustrate the main points ofthe preceding sections .
