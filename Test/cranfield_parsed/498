calculation of potential flow about bodies of revolutionhaving axes perpendicular to the free-stream direction ..Ahess,j.l..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962..Wcalculation of potential flow about bodies of revolutionhaving axes perpendicular to the free-stream direction .  a general method is described for calculating, with the aid ofan electronic computer, the potential flow about arbitrary bodiesof revolution whose axes are perpendicular to the free-streamdirection .  when combined with the solution for theaxisymmetric flow about these bodies, this method makes it possible tocalculate the pressure distribution on any body of revolution atangle of attack forward of any separated region of the flow, andalso to calculate the flow at points off the body surface .  afterthe basic equations of the method have been derived, its accuracyis exhibited by comparison with analytic solutions for ellipsoidsof revolution .  calculated pressure distributions are thencompared with experimental data for a variety of bodies .  theagreement is quite satisfactory in all cases .  the calculatedvelocities for other selected bodies are presented to exhibitcertain properties of this type of flow .
