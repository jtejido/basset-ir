on the analysis of elastic plates of variable thickness ..Amansfield,e.h..Bq. j. mech. app. math. 15, 1962, 167..Won the analysis of elastic plates of variable thickness .  the extensional and flexural equationsgoverning the elastic behaviour of a plateof variable thickness are expressed interms of the laplacian operator .temperature variations in the plane of theplate and across the thickness of the plateare taken into account .  general solutions are given for a rectangularplate whose thickness variesexponentially along the length, and for a circular,or annular, plate whose thickness variesas a power of the radius .  the large-deflexion equations, includingeffects of initial irregularities, are alsodiscussed .
