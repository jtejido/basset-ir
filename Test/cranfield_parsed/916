the flow around oscillating low aspect ratio wings at transonicspeeds ..Alandahl, m.t..Bkth aero. t.n.40, 1954 ..Wthe flow around oscillating low aspect ratio wings at transonicspeeds .when certain conditions are fulfilled for thickness ratio, aspect ratio, and reduced frequency for a three-dimensional wing, it can be shownthat the partial differential equation for the non-steady perturbationpotential can be reduced to a comparatively simple linear equation .the solution is then obtained by applying a fourier transformation inthe free-stream direction and then using an iterative process developedby adams and sears for steady flow . the method gives solutions validfor low combinations of aspect ratio and reduced frequency .the method is applied to a delta wing oscillating in some selected rigid and elastic modes . from the results it can be seen that the specialnon-steady forces in the potential equation, which are neglected inslender-body theory, are very important . stability derivatives can also be obtained by the method and it is seen that the damping in pitch maybe negative at m 1 for delta wings of too high aspect ratio .
