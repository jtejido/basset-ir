the shock pattern of a wing-body combination far fromthe flight path ..Awalkden,f..Baero. quart. 9, 1958, 164..Wthe shock pattern of a wing-body combination far fromthe flight path .  the position and strength of the front shock wave at largedistances from a wing-body combination, are deduced from the lineartheory for the combination, using a method developed by whitham .  thecombination consists of a body of revolution and a wing which hasthickness and is lifting .  the effects of interference between the flowover the body and the flow over the wing are included .  in anydirection the flow far from the wing-body combination is equivalent tothe flow past a body of revolution determined from the configuration ofthe combination .  the modified formulae for unsteady flow are given andsome results are evaluated for the combination of a body of revolutionand a delta wing with subsonic leading edges .
