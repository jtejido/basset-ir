buckling of transverse stiffened plates under shear ..Awang,t.k..Bj.app.mech. 3,1947, a269..Wbuckling of transverse stiffened plates under shear .  this paper presents an analysis of buckling of simplysupported rectangular plates reinforced by any number oftransverse stiffeners and subjected to shearing forcesuniformly distributed along the edges .  two cases areconsidered ..  (a) the case of a plate with a finite length,.ing stresses in both cases are expressed in similar forms,that is, in equation (13), andk in equation (24), respectively .  designcurves are drawn as shown in figs. 2,3, and 5 .
