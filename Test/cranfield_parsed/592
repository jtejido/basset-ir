design of axial compressors ..Ahowell, a.r..Bproc. i mech. e. v. 153, 1945 ..Wdesign of axial compressors .the main types of axial compressors are described, and the use ofgeneralized design curves to make performance estimates is advocated . thedifferent variables are weight, power, pressure ratio, temperature rise, mass flow, rotational speed, stage efficiency, blade bending stressesdue to aerodynamic loading, and methods and materials of construction .air outlets, flow coefficients and different blade forms are alsoconsidered .
