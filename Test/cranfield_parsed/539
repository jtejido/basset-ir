local heat transfer to a yawed, infite, circular cylinderin laminar compressible flow ..Aweiss,d..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962..Wlocal heat transfer to a yawed, infite, circular cylinderin laminar compressible flow .  this note presents a simplification of a method forcalculating the ratio of local to stagnation-line heat-transfercoefficients on a yawed, infinite, circular cylinder in laminarcompressible flow .  a brief description of the method of ref. 1 ispresented, followed by a discussion of the assumptions andmathematical procedure which lead to a considerable simplification .
