a summary of the supersonic pressure drag of bodiesof revolution ..Amorris,d.n..Bj.aero.scs. 28, 1961, 563..Wa summary of the supersonic pressure drag of bodiesof revolution .  a number of approximate theories for supersonic andhypersonic flow over bodies of revolution at zero angle of attack areappraised by a critical comparison with characteristics andsecond-order results, with the use of hypersonic similarity as abasis for the comparison .  most of the approximate theoriesare inadequate except over very limited ranges of fineness ratioand mach number .  the combination of second-ordersupersonic theory and second-order shock-expansion theory providesconsistently good results throughout the supersonic speed range .  on the basis of exact (or nearly exact) supersonic solutions anda limited amount of test data and theory in the transonic region,summary design curves are developed that give the pressuredrag of conical and ogive noses and conical and ogive boattailsover the complete range of transonic, supersonic, and hypersonicmach numbers .  other shapes can be analyzed in the samemanner, provided that an equivalent amount of data is available .  the analysis is made with the assumption of inviscid flow,so that the effects of boundary-layer growth, shockboundary-layer interaction, and flow separation are not included .  thepresent correlations provide a sound basis of inviscid-flow resultsfrom which these additional viscous effects can be evaluated .
