review of published data on the effect of roughness on transition fromlaminar to turbulent flow ..Ahugh l. dryden.Bnational advisory committee for aeronautics.Wreview of published data on the effect of roughness on transition fromlaminar to turbulent flow .a review is presented of the published data on the effect of roughness,especially single roughness elements, on transition from laminar toturbulent flow, in which an attempt is made to reanalyze and correlate theavailable information .  the reanalysis shows that the transitionreynolds number of a flat plate with zero pressure gradient is afunction of the ratio of the height of the roughness element to thedisplacement thickness of the boundary layer at the element, this functionalrelation being a better representation of the data than a constantcritical reynolds number of the roughness element .  other data show that theeffects of roghness are similar in streams of different initialturbulence and that a plot of the ratio of transition reynolds number of therough plate to that for the smooth plate against the ratio of the heightof the roughness element to displacement thickness of the boundary layerat the element gives good correlation of all the data for a given shapewhen transition occurs downstream from theroughness element .  at a certain value of the height-thickness ratiodependent on the stream speed, location of roughness element, andairstream turbulence, the transition position reaches the element andremains there as the height or the stream speed is further increased .the paper also discusses available data on the effect of distributedroughness on transition on a flat plate, as well as some of thepublished data on roughness effects on transition on air-foils .
