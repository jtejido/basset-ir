notes on waves through gases at pressures small comparedwith the magnetic pressure, with applications to upperatmosphere aerodynamics ..Alighthill,m.j..Bj. fluid mech. 9, 1960, 465..Wnotes on waves through gases at pressures small comparedwith the magnetic pressure, with applications to upperatmosphere aerodynamics .most treatments of magnetohydrodynamicwaves have confined physicalinterpretation to cases when the alfven velocity ais small compared with the soundvelocity a .  here we consider the 'low-betasituation', in which a is muchlarger than a .  then, except for two modes withwave velocity a the only possiblewaves are longitudinal ones, propagatedunidirectionally along lines of magneticforce with velocity a .  these can beinterpreted as sound waves, confined toeffectively rigid magnetic tubes of force .hall-current effects do not alter theseconclusions (in contrast to the high-betasituation), and finite conductivityintroduces only small dissipation .  an application is made to the flow patternaround a body moving through thef layer of the ionosphere, where, althoughneutral particles have a very largemean free path, charged particles interactelectrostatically and, it is argued, maybe regarded as forming a continuous fluidwhose movement is independent ofthat of the neutral particles .  a body movingat satellite speed or below wouldthen excite the above-mentioned unidirectionalsound waves, but no waves atmuch faster alfven velocity .  these considerationssuggest that its movementwould be accompanied by a v-shaped pattern ofelectron density (figure 2),which might be in part responsible for someanomalous radar echoes that havebeen reported .
