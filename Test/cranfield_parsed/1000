free-flight measurements of the static and dynamicstability and drag of a 10 blunted cone at mach numbers3 .5 and 8 .5 ..Aintrieri, p. f..Bnasa tn. d1299, 1962..Wfree-flight measurements of the static and dynamicstability and drag of a 10 blunted cone at mach numbers3. 5 and 8 .5 .tests were made of a short blunt-nosedwithout a 50 half-angle conical afterbodyin a pressurized ballisticrange at nominal mach numbers of 3.5 andof 90,000 and 220,000, respectively .  itwas found that the models werestatically stable about the center-of-gravity location tested butexhibited neutral dynamic stability for flightat constant altitude .  thestatic stability was not affected by thebut was nonlinear with angle of attackand varied with mach number .  thenonlinear variation of the pitching momentwith angle of attack wasaccurately approximated by a cubic polynomial .the static stability was onlyqualitatively predicted by modified newtoniantheory .  the dragcharacteristics were in good agreement with valuescalculated by use of modifiednewtonian theory .  calculations of the oscillatorybehavior of the configurations flyingan example entry trajectory throughthe martian atmosphere indicated theconfigurations to be dynamicallysatisfactory .  pitching motions shouldconverge to a small fraction of theamplitude at entry, provided theinitial angle of attack and pitchrate are not large enough to causetumbling .
