pressure measurements at supersonic speeds on threeuncambered conical wings of unit aspect ratio ..Abritton,j.w..Brae tn.aero.2821, 1962..Wpressure measurements at supersonic speeds on threeuncambered conical wings of unit aspect ratio .  pressure measurements were made at mach numbers between 1.3 and 2.8over a range of incidences on three simple models representing thickconical uncambered wings with sharp leading edges .  these tests formpart of an investigation into the effects of thickness and camber onslender wings .  the aspect ratio of the models was unity in each case, and thespanwise cross sections were boundedby ..  the measured pressure distributions are presented, along with overalllift and drag (excluding skin friction and base drag) obtained byintegration .
