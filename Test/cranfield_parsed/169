on the sudden contact between a hot gas and a cold solid ..Aj. f. clarke, b.sc., ph.d., a.f.r.ae.s..B.Won the sudden contact between a hot gas and a cold solid .the flow induced by the sudden contact between a semi-infinite expanseof gas and a solid, initially at different temperatures, is examined onthe basis of a linear continuum theory .  for times large compared withthe mean time between molecular collisions in the gas, the velocityand pressure disturbances are found to be concentrated around a wavefront propagating out from the interface at the ambient isentropic soundspeed, whilst, near to the interface, these disturbances are small andthe gas temperatures are nearly equal to those predicted by theclassical constant pressure heat conduction theory .the possible significance of these results in connection withreflected shock wave techniques to measure high temperature gas properties iscommented upon .
