constant-temperature magneto-gasdynamic channel flow ..Akerrebrock,j.p. and marble,f.e..Bj. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 78..Wconstant-temperature magneto-gasdynamic channel flow .in the course of investigating boundary-layer flow incontinuous plasma accelerators with crossed electric andmagnetic fields, it was found advantageous to have at hand simpleclosed-form solutions for the magneto-gasdynamic flow in theduct which could serve as free-stream conditions for the boundarylayers .  nontrivial solutions of this sort are not available atpresent, and in fact, as in the work of resler and sears, thevariation of conditions along the flow axis must be obtainedthrough numerical integration .  consequently, some simple solutions of magneto-gasdynamicchannel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicityto serve as free-stream boundary conditions for analyticinvestigations of the boundary layer in a physically reasonable accelerator .in particular, since the cooling of the accelerator tube is likely tobe an important physical problem because of the high gastemperatures required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity,channel flow with constant temperature appears interesting .some simple algebraic solutions for the case of a constanttemperature plasma are developed in the following paragraphs .
