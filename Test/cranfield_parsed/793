the flow pattern on a tapered sweptback wing at mach numbers between 0.6 and 1.6 ..Ahall, i.m. and rogers, e.w.e..Ba.r.c. r + m 3271, part 1, july 1960 ..Wthe flow pattern on a tapered sweptback wing at mach numbers between 0.6 and 1.6 .the development of the flow pattern on a swept wing with incidence andstream mach number is described . the wing, of aspect ratio 2 828,taper ratio 0 333 and leading-edge sweep 53 5 deg, was tested at machnumbers between 0 6 and 1 6 at incidences up to about 12 deg . the testreynolds number varied with mach number, being typically 2 3 x 10 at mleading edge .it is shown that the flow pattern at moderate incidences developssmoothly from a subsonic type involving leading-edge separation to asupersonic type where the flow is attached near the leading edge andwith shock-induced separation further aft . the formation and movementof the shock-wave system and the vortices near the wing surface arebriefly discussed .
