second order theory for unsteady supersonic flowpast slender pointed bodies of revolution ..Arevell, j. d..Bj. ae. scs.1960, 730..Wsecond order theory for unsteady supersonic flowpast slender pointed bodies of revolution .  the thermodynamic properties (z = pv rt, e rt, h rt, s r,and pressure) are given for equilibrium mixtures of dissociated andionized molecules and atoms of the elements nitrogen and oxygenhaving the low temperature composition of .78847 n and .21153 o .the tabulated properties of this mixture (a close approximation tothe properties of air) are given at close intervals from 2000 toand 10 times the normal density .  the results are based onchemical equilibria between the species o, o, n, n, no, no, no,no, o, o, o, o, n, n, n and electrons .  the method ofpresentation permits later corrections for the effect of argon and coand the contribution of intermolecular forces .  the calculations arebased on 9.758 e.v. as the dissociation energy of molecular nitrogenand 1.45 e.v. as the electron affinity of atomic oxygen .
