performance estimates for the rae 6in . high-pressureshock tube ..Awoods,n.a..Barc 20,440, 1958..Wperformance estimates for the rae 6in . high-pressureshock tube .  estimates are made of the performanceof the rae 6'' high pressureshock tube, with various driver gases, overa range of pressure ratios givingshock mach numbers from 6 to 22 .  thecalculations are based on a simplifiedmodel of shock tube flow, in which theworking fluid (argon-free air) isassumed to be always in chemicalequilibrium, and the driver gas (eitherhydrogen, or the products of combustionof a hydrogen-oxygen mixture) isassumed to behave as an ideal gas withconstant specifiic heats .  the results are presented ingraphical form and comprise chartsnormal shock waves in argon-free airshock wave mach number and diaphragmpressure ratio under various initial conditions, andof the shock-induced flows, bothin the uniform-sectioned shock tube, andwhen expanded in a divergent nozzle
