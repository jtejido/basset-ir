the performance of supersonic turbine nozzles ..Astratford,b.s. and sansome,g.e..Barc r + m 3273, 1959..Wthe performance of supersonic turbine nozzles .  an investigation has been conductedat the national gas turbine establishment into theperformance of turbines having high pressure ratiosper stage .  the present report discusses the mode ofoperation of supersonic nozzles for such turbines,and describes a cascade experiment .  both theory andexperiment demonstrate that the conditions imposedupon the supersonic flow immediately downstreamof the nozzles (e.g., by a following row of rotor blades)exert an overriding influence upon the nozzle outletflow angle, and hence upon the maximum pressureratio obtainable across the nozzle--providing that theaxial component of velocity is subsonic .  this is animportant difference from the more familiar flow ofsubsonic turbine nozzles, where, for example, thedownstream gas angle is controlled predominantly by thenozzle blade shape and spacing .  a suitable test techniqueusing a closed-jet tunnel is demonstrated .  the particular nozzles tested, of convergent-divergentform, had a straight-sided divergent portion ofto axial direction) and a design mach number of 2 .the flow was found to be well behaved as regards shockpattern, losses, and starting over the range of pressureratios tested--between 9 1 and 19 1 .  in particular theefficiency at the design pressure ratio of 16.6 1 washigh, the velocity coefficient calculated from traverses ofpitot and static tubes being 0.98 .  for the conversion of pitot to total pressure at a machnumber of 2.5 a high accuracy is important in themeasurement of the static pressure,. nevertheless readingsfrom a conventional four-hole instrument appear tobe reliable .
