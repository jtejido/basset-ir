effects of internal pressure on the buckling of circular-cylindricalshells under bending..Aweingarten,v.i..B.Weffects of internal pressure on the buckling of circular-cylindricalshells under bending.  the effect of internal pressure on the small-deflection bucklingof thin-walled cylinders under bending is investigated by meansof a modified donnell equation .  the results indicate that themaximum critical stress due to bending increases with internalpressure, unlike the case of pressurized cylinders undercompression .  these results represent the moment at whichsignificant deformations appear in the cylinder, rather than themaximum moment able to be carried, but may be a goodapproximation to the latter for metal cylinders .
