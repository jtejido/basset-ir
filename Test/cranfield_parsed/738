finding zero's of arbitrary functions ..Afrank,w.l..Bj. assoc. comput. mach. 5, 1958, 154..Wfinding zero's of arbitrary functions .  a method for finding real and complexroots of polynomial equations, due tod. muller, is applied to finding roots ofgeneral equations of the form f(z) = 0,where f(z) is analytic in the neighborhoodof the roots .  the procedure does notdepend on any prior knowledge of thelocation of the roots nor on any specialstarting process .  all that is required isthe ability to evaluate f(z) for anydesired value of z .  multiple roots can also beobtained .  a general purpose program,prepared for the univac scientific 1103and 1103a, is described and numericalresults are presented for the followingapplications ..  finding eigenvalues ofdifferential operators ,. finding eigenvalues ofarbitrary matrices ,. finding zeros of thegeneralized eigenvalue problem ,. findingroots of a number of transcendentalequations .
