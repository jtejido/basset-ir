analysis of low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures ..Asamson,s.h. and bergmann,h.w..Bj. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 679..Wanalysis of low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures .  two methods are presented for the analysis of complex low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures .  both methods provide forarbitrary external loading, are general with respect to theorientation of structural members, and permit arbitrary boundaryconditions .  for purposes of analysis a structure is idealized as anetwork of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxes .  in the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained byexpressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations,equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationshipsin terms of deflections and internal forces .  the solution fordeflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of aninverse structural matrix and a column matrix of load functions .  in the second method, the conditions at a given boundary areassembled as a column matrix and are transferred in a stepby-step fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundary .the transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications ofsquare matrices composed independently for the differenttransfer ranges .  the final operation is the inversion of a relativelysmall matrix and provides the solution for the unknown boundaryconditions .  comparisons of theoretical results with experimental data andelectric-analog solutions are favorable .
