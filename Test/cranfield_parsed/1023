note on creep buckling of columns ..A.B.Wnote on creep buckling of columns .  a theory of creep buckling is presented in which the instantaneouselastic and plastic deformations following the application of a load, aswell as the steady creep deformations, are considered in an approximatemanner .  equations are given from which the critical time, that is, thetime elapsing between load application and the collapse of the column,can be computed .
