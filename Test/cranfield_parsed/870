effect of rheological behaviour on thermal stresses ..Afreudenthal,a.m..Bj.app.phys. 25, 1954..Weffect of rheological behaviour on thermal stresses .  since the conventional elastic analysis of thermal stress problemscoupled with limiting creep rates and time-dependent fracture stressesas (inelastic) design criteria, results in design procedures for thermalstresses (in heat exchangers, nuclear reactors, flight structures atsupersonic speeds, etc.) of considerable unreality, the effect ofvarious types of rheological behavior (viscoelastic, plastic, workhardening) on the level of thermal stresses is analyzed under simplifiedassumptions, such as uniaxial stress and polar or cylindrical symmetry .the effect on the thermal stress intensity of the rheological behaviorof the material is shown to be very significant, particularly withrespect to stress relaxation and the development of residual stresses .
