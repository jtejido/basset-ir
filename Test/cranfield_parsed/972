aerodynamic interaction effects ahead of a sonic jet exhaustingperpendicularly form a flat plate into a mach number 6 free stream ..Aromeo, d.j. and sterrett, j.r..Bnasa tn d-743, april 1961 ..Waerodynamic interaction effects ahead of a sonic jet exhaustingperpendicularly form a flat plate into a mach number 6 free stream .an investigation of the effects of the interaction ahead of atwo-dimensional sonic jet exhausting perpendicularly into a mach numberwere made at an angle of attack of 0degree at a reynolds number per foot of approximately 6 x 10 and with conditions of both transitional andturbulent separation on the flat plate . the ratio of jet stagnationpressure to free-stream static pressure was varied from 8 to 460 and the jet slot width was varied from 0.001 to 0.05 inch . the force ratio due to reaction of jet/, calculated ahead of the jet, was sizable andvaried from 0.5 to 9 . in general, the ratio increased with increasingpressure ratio and decreasing slot width . for the turbulentboundary-layer separation tests it was found that the first peak pressure and the chordwise pressure distribution of the separated boundary layer aheadof the jet were similar to those for a separation caused by aforward-facing step at the same test conditions .
