on the theory of thin elastic toroidal shells ..Aclark,r.a..Bj. math. phys. 29, 1950, 146..Won the theory of thin elastic toroidal shells .  the author obtains asymptotic solutions to the problemof rotationally symmetric small deflection of thin toroidalelastic shells .  he first reduces the problem to that ofintegrating a single linear nonhomogeneous ordinary differentialequation involving two parameters .  asymptotic formulaefor the complementary function are obtained by applyingthe general method of langer (trans.amer.math.soc.33,advantage of yielding results valid near the points wherethe tangent plane is perpendicular to the axis of revolution,where the methods of asymptotic integration customary inshell theory fail (see the preceding review) .  for twoproblems in which only the complementary function is required,the author's results are compared with those obtained bywissler (dissertation, zurich, 1916) by a method of powerseries expansion,. the agreement is within 4 or better .  theauthor observes that the usual method of obtainingasymptotic expressions for a particular integral, being based onusing as an approximation the complementary functionobtained from the membrane theory, will fail near pointswhere the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axis ofrevolution .  he therefore introduces a new method, whichhe states was developed jointly with e. reissner .  he applieshis results to the cases of an joint loaded symmetricallyand parallel to its axis, a corrugated pipe subject to axialload, and a corrugated cylinder subject to axial pressure .many numerical calculations are involved and there are twotables of functions occuring in the solutions .
