hangling qualities experience with several vtol researchaircraft ..Areeder,j.p..Bnasa tn.d735, 1961..Whangling qualities experience with several vtol researchaircraft .  all of the vtol research aircraftdiscussed in this paper havesuccessfully demonstrated conversion fromhovering to airplane flight andvice versa .  however, control about oneor more axes of these aircrafthas been inadequate in hovering flight .furthermore, ground interferenceeffects have been severe in some casesand have accentuated the inadequacyof control in hovering and very lowspeed flight .  stalling of wing surfaces has resultedin limitations in level-flightdeceleration and in descent, particularlyfor the tilt-wing aircraft, whichin this case is a very rudimentary type .minor modifications to the wingleading edge have, however, producedsurprisingly large and encouragingreductions in adverse stall effects .  height control in hovering and inlow-speed flight has proved tobe a problem for the aircraft not havingdirect control of the pitch ofthe rotors .  the other systems have shownundesirable time lags indevelopment of a thrust change .
