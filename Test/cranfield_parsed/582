the melting of finite slabs ..Agoodman,t.r. and shea,j.j..Bj. app. mech. 27, 1960, 16..Wthe melting of finite slabs .an approximate method, known as theheat-balance integral, is used to determine themelting rate of a finite slab which is initiallyat a uniform temperature below the meltingpoint .  the slab is acted upon by aconstant heat input at one face and has its otherface either insulated or kept at its initialtemperature .  the first three terms of seriessolutions in an intrinsically small parameterare obtained for the time histories ofmelting and the temperature distribution in the slab .
