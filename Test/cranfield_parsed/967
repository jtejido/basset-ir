a study of laminar compressible viscous pipe flow accelerated by anaxial body force, with application to magnetogasdynamics ..Amartin, d.e..Bnasa tn d-855, april 1961 ..Wa study of laminar compressible viscous pipe flow accelerated by anaxial body force, with application to magnetogasdynamics .a study is made of the steady laminar flow of a compressible viscousfluid in a circular pipe when the fluid is accelerated by an axialbody force . the application of the theory to the magnetofluidmechanicsof an electrically conducting gas accelerated by electric and magneticfields is discussed . constant viscosity, thermal conductivity, andelectrical conductivity are assumed . fully developed flow velocity andtemperature profiles are shown, and detailed results of the accelerating flow development, including velocity and pressure as functions ofdistance, are given for the case where the axial body force is constant and for the case where it is a linear function of velocity . from theseresults are determined the pipe entry length and the pressure difference required .
