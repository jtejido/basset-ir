further comments on the inversion of large structural matrices ..Acharles h. samson, jr..Bprofessor, departments of aeronautical and civil engineering,a. and m. college of texas.Wfurther comments on the inversion of large structural matrices .in a recent note, klein referred to a paper co-authored by the writer,and to ref. 3 .  regarding the subject of inversion of large-ordermatrices, klein stated that he would show 'that the situation is not ashopeless as the anove-mentioned authors intimate' .the purpose of this note is not to take exception to klein/sconclusions, but rather to disagree with his implication that theauthors of ref. 2 were pessimistic with respect to large-matrixinversions .  two general methods of analysis were treated..  themethod of consistent distortion and the method of transfer matrices .the first method leads directly to a relatively large matrix ofstructural coefficients of both internal forces and displacements .this matrix must be inverted to solve the problem .  the second methodultimately produces a relatively small matrix requiring inversion.,however, to arrive at this point one must perform a number of matrixmultiplications .
