some theoretical low-speed loading characteristicsof swept wings in roll and sideslip ..Abird,j.d..Bnaca r969, 1950..Wsome theoretical low-speed loading characteristicsof swept wings in roll and sideslip .  the weissinger method for determining additional spanloading for incompressible flow is used to find the damping inroll, the lateral center of pressure of the rolling load, and thespan loading coefficients caused by rolling for wing plan formsof various aspect ratios, taper ratios, and sweep angles .  inaddition, the applicability of the method to the determinationof certain other aerodynamic derivatives is investigated, andcorrections for the first-order effects of compressibility areindicated .  the agreement obtained between experimentally andtheoretically determined values for the aerodynamic coefficientsindicates that the method of weissinger is well suited to thecalculation of the additional span loading caused by rollingand for the calculation of such resulting aerodynamicderivatives of wings as do not involve considerations of tip suction .
