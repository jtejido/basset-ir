on the ground level disturbance from large aircraftflying at supersonic speeds ..Alilley,g.m. and spillman,j.j..Bcoa n103..Won the ground level disturbance from large aircraftflying at supersonic speeds .  the whitham-walkden theory for the estimation of the strengthof shock waves at ground level from aircraft flying at supersonicspeeds is applied to the case of a typical projected supersonic civiltransport aeroplane .  if a figure of 2 lb sq.ft. (including a factor of 2 for groundreflection) is taken as an upper limit for the acceptable strength ofthe bow wave from such an aircraft it is shown that restrictions onthe climb and flight plan will be involved .  the advantage of theemployment of larger engines with or without afterburning is discussed,with reference also to the penalties involved owing to the increase inweight of the aircraft and its direct operating costs .  finally it is suggested that an aircraft of given volume could bedesigned, by suitable choice of thickness and lift distribution, tominimise the strength of the shock waves in the far field .
