some effects of surface curvature on laminar boundarylayer flow ..Amurphy,j.s..Bj.aero.scs. 20, 1953, 338..Wsome effects of surface curvature on laminar boundarylayer flow .  the laminar flow of a viscous incompressible fluid over atwo-dimensional curved surface is investigated for two cases, one inwhich the curvature is /large/ and the other in which it iscases are obtained as approximations from the exact equations ofmotion by an order-of-magnitude analysis .  these equations aresolved for flow over a particular surface with zero surface pressuregradient .  in this analysis, the pressure gradient normal to thesurface is included, and the outer boundary conditions aremodified in accordance with the requirements of flow over a curvedsurface .  the results indicate that for equal reynolds numbers, thestress on convex surfaces is less than the flat-plate value, whilethe stress on concave surfaces is greater than for a flat plate .  themost important effect of surface curvature, for the casesconsidered, is the modification of the shape of the velocity profilenear the /outer edge/ of the boundary layer .  the requirementthat a smooth transition exist between the viscous flow and thepotential flow at the outer edge of the layer causes the profile tohave a negative slope near the outer edge for convex surfacecurvature and a positive slope for concave surface curvature .
