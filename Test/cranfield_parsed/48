supersonic flow at the surface of a circular cone atangle of attack ..Awillett,j.e..Bj. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 907..Wsupersonic flow at the surface of a circular cone atangle of attack .  formulas for the inviscid flow properties on the surface of acone at angle of attack are derived for use in conjunction withthe m.i.t. cone tables .  these formulas are based upon anentropy distribution on the cone surface which is uniform andequal to that of the shocked fluid in the windward meridianplane .  they predict values for the flow variables which maydiffer significantly from the corresponding values obtaineddirectly from the cone tables .  the differences in the magnitudesof the flow variables computed by the two methods tend toincrease with increasing free-stream mach number, cone angleand angle of attack .
