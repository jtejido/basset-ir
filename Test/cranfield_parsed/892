research on unsteady flow ..Ajones,w.p..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 249..Wresearch on unsteady flow .  this is a survey of certain recent advances made in the studyof aerodynamic unsteady flow and of some of the new problemsarising which require further investigation .  no attempt is made toreproduce classical theory, but emphasis rather is laid on validityand general usefulness, particular attention being given tounsteady boundary-layer effects, especially when there is flowseparation .  coverage is broad and author thus provides a useful reviewfor those interested in this field .
