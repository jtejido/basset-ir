wing-nacelle-propeller interference for wings of variousspans . force and pressure distribution tests ..Arobinson,r.g. and herrnstein,w.h..Bnaca r.569, 1936..Wwing-nacelle-propeller interference for wings of variousspans . force and pressure distribution tests .  an experimental investigation was made in then. a. c. a. full-scale wind tunnel to determine the effectof wing span on nacelle-propeller characteristics and,reciprocally, the lateral extent of nacelle and propellerinfluence on a monoplane wing .  the results provide acheck on the validity of the previous research on nacellesand propellers with 15-foot-span wings tested in the  the scale propeller and the n. a. c. a. cowlingused in the former researches were tested in three typicaltractor locations with respect to a thick wing of 5-footchord and 30-foot span .  the span was progressivelyreduced to 25,20, and 15 feet and the same characteristicswere measured in each case .  the efficiency factors--propulsive efficiency, nacelledrag efficiency, and net efficiency--were obtained for eachwing length by means of force tests and the values arecompared to determine the effect of span .pressure-distribution measurements show the lateral extent of thenacelle interference and the propeller-slipstream effecton the span loading for the various conditions .  completepolar curves and curves showing the variation of nacelledrag with lift coefficient are also included .  force and pressure-distribution tests concur inindicating that, for engineering purposes, the influence of anacelle and of a propeller, in a usual combination, maybe considered to extend laterally on a wing the samemaximum distance, or about five nacelle diameters or twopropeller diameters outboard of their common axes .  allimportant effects of scale nacelle-propellercombinations may be measured within practical limits of accuracyby tests of a 15-foot-span wing .
