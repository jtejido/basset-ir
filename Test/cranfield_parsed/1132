general instability of ring stiffened cylindrical shellssubject to external hydrostatic pressure - a comparisonof theory and experiment ..Agalletly,d.d..Bj. app. mech. 25, 1958, 259..Wgeneral instability of ring stiffened cylindrical shellssubject to external hydrostatic pressure - a comparisonof theory and experiment .  tests are described of a number of machined-stiffenedcylinders subjected to external hydrostatic pressure, and theobserved general instability strengths compared with predictionsfrom theories of kendrick and nash .  agreement with kendrickwas found rather good .  results also are presented fromelectrical strain gages which show in detail the growth of embryoniclobes and nonlinear characteristics of deformation at thethreshold of buckling .  weakening effects of imperfect circularity arediscussed .
