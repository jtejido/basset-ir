laminar hypersonic trail in the expansion-conductionregion ..Alykoudis,p.s..Baiaa jnl. 1963, 772..Wlaminar hypersonic trail in the expansion-conductionregion .  the usual procedure in calculating the coolingprocess in a wake behind a blunt object is toassume a region of pure expansion up to a distancewhere the pressure has reached its ambientvalue, followed by a region where the mechanismof pure heat conduction is operative .  inthe present paper both mechanisms are assumedto be valid simultaneously, and the result iscompared with previous calculations .  thefollowing criterion is established ..  the minimumradius of a hemisphere-cylinder configuration,above which a simultaneousconduction-expansion calculation is not needed, is given bythe approximationwhere is the nondimensional valueof the enthalpy at the axis of the wake belowwhich the two methods of computation give thesame result, and m is the flight mach number .
