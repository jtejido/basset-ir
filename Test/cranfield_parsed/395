new methods in heat flow analysis with applicationto flight structures ..Abiot,m.a..Bj. ae. scs. 24, 1957..Wnew methods in heat flow analysis with applicationto flight structures .  new methods are presented for the analysis of transient heatflow in complex structures, leading to drastic simplifications inthe calculation and the possibility of including nonlinear andsurface effects .  these methods are in part a direct application ofsome general variational principles developed earlier for linearthermodynamics .  they are further developed in theparticular case of purely thermal problems to include surface andboundary-layer heat transfer, nonlinear systems withtemperature-dependent parameters, and radiation .  the concepts ofthermal potential, dissipation function, and generalized thermalforce are introduced, leading to ordinary differential equationsof the lagrangian type for the thermal flow field .  because of theparticular nature of heat flow phenomena, compared withdynamics, suitable procedures must be developed in order to formulateeach problem in the simplest way .  this is done by treating anumber of examples .  the concepts of penetration depth andtransit time are introduced and discussed in connection withone-dimensional flow .  application of the general method to theheating of a slab, with temperature-dependent heat capacity,shows a substantial difference between the heating and coolingprocesses .  an example of heat flow analysis of a supersonic wingstructure by the present method is also given and requires onlyextremely simple calculations .  the results are found to be ingood agreement with those obtained by the classical and muchmore elaborate procedures .
