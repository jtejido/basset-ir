the shock wave noise problem of supersonic aircraftin steady flight ..Amaglieri,d.j. and carlson,h.w..Bnasa memo 3-4-59l, 1959..Wthe shock wave noise problem of supersonic aircraftin steady flight .  data are presented which providean insight into the nature of theshock-wave noise problem, the significantvariables involved, and themanner in which airplane operationmay be affected .  flight-test dataare also given, and a comparison withthe available theory is made .  anattempt is also made to correlate thesubjective reactions of observersand some associated physical phenomenawith the pressure amplitudesduring full-scale flight .  it is indicated that for the proposedsupersonic transport airplanesof the future, booms on the ground willmost probably be experiencedduring the major portion of the flightplan .  the boom pressures will bemost severe during the climb and descentphases of the flight plan .during the cruise phase of the flight,the boom pressures are of muchlesser intensity but are spread laterallyfor many miles .  the mannerin which the airplane is operated appearsto be significant,. for example,the boom pressures during the climb,cruise, and descent phases can beminimized by operating the airplane atits maximum altitude consistentwith its performance capabilities .
