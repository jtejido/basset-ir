lift of slender delta wings according to newtoniantheory ..Amessiter,a.f..Baiaa jnl. 1963,795.Wlift of slender delta wings according to newtoniantheory .  an approximate system of equations is derived todescribe the inviscid flow past a flat slenderwing at angle of attack, in the limit and .the aspect ratio is required toapproach zero at the same rate as the mach angle inthe flow behind the shock wave .  only asingle parameter appears in the resulting equations,and a similarity law therefore can bewritten expressing a correction to the newtoniannormal-force coefficient .  for the delta wing,a correlation of experimental data according to thesimilarity law is shown, and the first termsof the solution are derived under the assumptionthat the similarity parameter is small (vertex angle much smaller than mach angle) .
