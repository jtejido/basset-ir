static aerodynamic characteristics of short blunt coneswith various nose and base cone angles at mach numbersof 0. 6 to 5. 5 and angles of attack to 180 ..Atreon,s.l..Bnasa tn.d1327, 1962..Wstatic aerodynamic characteristics of short blunt coneswith various nose and base cone angles at mach numbersof 0. 6 to 5. 5 and angles of attack to 180 .  wind-tunnel tests have been performedat mach numbers from 0.6 to 5.5to determine coefficients of normal force,axial force, and pitchingmoment for short blunt cones, as affectedby changes in nose and basecone angles .  models with nose half-anglesof 10 and 20 were investigated .the 10 nose half-angle models were testedwith a flat base and with basecones of 50 and 70 half-angle .  the 20nose half-angle model had a 50half-angle base cone .  reynolds numbersfor the test ranged from aboutmaximum diameter .  variations in the base cone angleresulted in significant changes inthe aerodynamic characteristics, withlesser effects resulting from changesin nose cone angle .  in particular,the model with the 50 half-angleconical base had only one trim angleflat base and 70 half-angle conicalbase had two trim angles (a = 0 anda = 180) .  estimated variations ofthe aerodynamic characteristics withangle of attack by means of a modifiednewtonian theory were in goodagreement with the experimental results .the theory, however, failed topredict the trim point at a = 180 forthe flat-based model .
