temperature charts for induction and constant temperatureheating ..Aheisler,m.p..Ba.s.m.e.trans. 14, 1947, 227..Wtemperature charts for induction and constant temperatureheating .  charts are presented for determining completetemperature historics in spheres, cylinders, and plates .  itis shown that for values of the dimensionless time ratiox greater than 0.2 the heating equations reduce to sucha simple form that for each shape two charts which givetemperatures at any position within the heated or cooledbodies can be plotted .  it is also shown that the usualsimple heating and cooling charts can also be used for thedetermination of temperatures and heating times inbodies heated by a constant rate of heat generation atthe surface (induction heating) .  finally, a twodimensional chart is given for finding heating times in shortcylinders, thereby eliminating the trial-and-errorsolution that is necessary when heating times are found fromthe present one-dimensional charts .
