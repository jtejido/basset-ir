a geometric problem related to the optimum distributionof lift on a planar wing in supersonic flow ..Agraham,e.w..Bj. ae. scs. 1958, 771..Wa geometric problem related to the optimum distributionof lift on a planar wing in supersonic flow .  the problem studied may be regarded as a problem ofgeometry .  its simplest form (loosely stated) is then as follows ..  amountain rises up from the x-y plane .  determine the exactshape of the mountain knowing only the cross-sectional area ofevery possible cut which can be made through the mountain witha vertical plane .  in a more complicated version of the problem,the given information might be restricted to the cross-sectionalarea of every cut which can be made by a vertical plane inclinedless than 45 to the y-axis .  this latter case has direct applications to certain minimumdrag problems in supersonic flow .  the shape of the mountaincorresponds to the (unknown) shape of the optimum liftdistribution on a planar wing .  the cross-sectional area of a cut isthe integrated value of the lift along a straight line crossing thewing plan form .  for a restricted range of line inclinations, theseoptimum integrated lift values can sometimes be determineddirectly .  here it is assumed that they are given .  the problem in its simplest form was originally solved byradon, who found solutions for a large class of such problems .the derivation presented here may perhaps be more readilyunderstood .
