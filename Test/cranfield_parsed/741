the behaviour of thin cylindrical shells after bucklingunder axial compression ..Amichielsen,h.f..Bj. ae. scs. 15, 1948, 738..Wthe behaviour of thin cylindrical shells after bucklingunder axial compression .  the fundamental investigations of von karman and tsienon the buckling of cylindrical shells under axial compressionare continued .  the energy expression is simplified andminimized with respect to the axial and circumferential wave-lengthparameters .  solution of the equations obtained yields curvesof the reduced average stress and of the wave dimensions plottedagainst the reduced average strain .  they illustrate the behaviorof the cylinder during the buckling process .  the minimumbuckling stress is found to be 0.195e(tr) .
