air pressure on a cone moving at high speeds ..Ataylor,g.i. and maccoll,j.w..Bproc. roy. soc. a, 139, 1933, 278..Wair pressure on a cone moving at high speeds .  the cone is considered to bemoving at a velocity higher than thatof sound, so that there is in frontof it a shock wave, moving with thesame speed as the cone itself .  inthe first part of the paper, the case isinvestigated mathematically wherethe flow is irrotational, and thepressure, velocity and density of the airstream are each constant over thesurfaces of cones coaxial with themoving solid cone .  the completesolution is obtained in numericalform, for cones of semi-vertical angleof the paper, the results are comparedwith experiment, both in respect ofpressure distribution as measured in awind tunnel, and also (for the 30cone) by comparison with photographsof bullets in flight .  in the latter casethe theory should only be applicableif the speed is 1.46 or more times thevelocity of sound, and it is in factfound in the photographs, that the natureof the wave alters at about thisvelocity .  the exact solution found, iscompared with an approximationgiven recently by v. karman and moore .this should be valid for thinspindle-shaped bodies, and does in factagree well in the case of the coneof 10 semi-vertical angle, but divergesincreasingly from the truth asthe angle is increased .
