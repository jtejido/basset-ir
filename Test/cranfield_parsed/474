laminar mixing of a compressible fluid ..Adean r. chapman.B.Wlaminar mixing of a compressible fluid .a theoretical investigation of the velocity profiles for laminarmixing of a high-velocity stream with a region of fluid at resthas been made assuming that the prandtl number is unity .  a methodwhich involves only quadratures is presented for calculating thevelocity profile in the mixing layer for an arbitrary value of thefree-stream mach number .detailed velocity profiles have been calculated for free-stream machnumbers of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 .  for each mach number, velocity profilesare presented for both a linear and a 0.76-power variation of viscositywith absolute temperature .  the calculations for a linear variation aremuch simpler than those for a 0.76-power variation .  it is shown thatby selecting the constant of proportionality in the linear approximationsuch that it gives the correct value for the viscosity in thehigh-temperature part of the mixing layer, the resulting velocity profilesare in excellent agreement with those calculated by a 0.76-powervariation .
