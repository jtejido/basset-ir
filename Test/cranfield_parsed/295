a note on transitional heat transfer under hypersonic conditions ..Aconstantino economos and paul a. libby.Bresearch assistant and professor of aeronautical engineering,respectivelypolytechnic institute of brooklyn, brooklyn, n.y..Wa note on transitional heat transfer under hypersonic conditions .in references 1 and 2 there were presented experimental data ontransitional heat transfer on a blunt body under hypersonic-flowconditions obtained by the shroud technique .  the data were comparedwith a theoretical prediction of transitional heat transfer basedon a suggestion of persh .  the agreement between theory and experimentin the transitional region was found to be 'qualitatively good andquantitatively fair' .it is the purpose of this note to present some additional transitionaldata obtained in conventional wind-tunnel tests and to indicate ameans for improving somewhat the agreement between transitionaltheory and experiment .
