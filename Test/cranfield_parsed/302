approximations for the thermodynamic and transport properties of hightemperature air ..Ahansen, c. f..Bnasa tr r 50, 1959 ..Wapproximations for the thermodynamic and transport properties of hightemperature air .the thermodynamic and transport properties of high-temperature air arefound in closed form starting from approximate partition functions forthe major components in air and neglecting all minor components . thecompressibility, enthalpy, entropy, the specific heats, the speed ofsound, the coefficients of viscosity and of thermal conductivity, andthe prandtl numbers for air are tabulated from 500degree to 15,000degree k over a range of pressure from 0.0001 to 100 atmospheres . the energyof air and the mol fractions of the major components of air can be found from the tabulated values for compressibility and enthalpy . it ispredicted that the prandtl number for fully ionized air, which is incomplete equilibrium, will become small compared to unity, the order oftransparent to heat flux .
