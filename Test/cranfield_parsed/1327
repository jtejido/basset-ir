on the propagation and structure of the blast wave ..Asakurai,a..Bj. phys. soc. japan, 8, 1953, 662..Won the propagation and structure of the blast wave .  concerning blast waves with front surfaces of plane, cylindrical andspherical shape, the propagation velocity u and the distribution ofhydrodynamical quantities are discussed .  the solutions are constructedin the form of power series in (c u), where c is the sound velocity ofundisturbed fluid .  especially r, the distance of shock front from thecharge, is represented as,where r is the characteristic length related to the energy of explosion,j and are constants, and a=0,1,2 correspond to plane, cylindrical andspherical case, respectively .  in this paper the first approximationsfor a=0,1 are discussed (the case a=2 has been discussed by g. i.taylor) .  the solution is obtained numerically for the case of theadiabatic index .  the approximate solution is also considered .  usingthese solutions, is found to be .  the second approximation will appear in part 2 to be publishedsubsequently .
