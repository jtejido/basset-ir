flexural vibrations of the walls of thin cylindricalshells having freely supported ends ..Aarnold,r.n. and warburton,g.b..Bproc. roy. soc. a, 197, 1949, 238..Wflexural vibrations of the walls of thin cylindricalshells having freely supported ends .the paper deals with the general equations for the vibration of thincylinders and a theoretical and experimental investigation is made ofthe type of vibration usually associated with bells .  the cylinders aresupported in such a manner that the ends remain circular withoutdirectional restraint being imposed .  it is found that the complexityof the mode of vibration bears little relation to the naturalfrequency,. for example, cylinders of very small thickness-diameterratio, with length about equal to or less than the diameter, may havemany of their higher frequencies associated with the simpler modes ofvibration .  the frequency equation which is derived by the energymethod is based on strain relations given by timoshenko .  in thisapproach, displacement equations are evolved which are comparable tothose of love and flugge, though differences are evident due to thestrain expressions used by each author .  results are given forcylinders of various lengths, each with the same thickness-diameterratio, and also for a very thin cylinder in which the simpler modes ofvibration occur in the higher frequency range .  it is shown that thereare three possible natural frequencies for a particular nodal pattern,two of these normally occurring beyond the aural range .
