the production of uniform shear flow in a wind tunnel ..Aowen,p.r. and zienkiewicz,h.k..Bj.fluid mech. 2, 1957, 521..Wthe production of uniform shear flow in a wind tunnel .  a nearly uniform shear flow was obtained in the workingsection of a wind tunnel by inserting a grid of parallel rods withvarying spacing .  the function of such a grid is to impose a resistance to theflow, so graded across the working section as to produce a linearvariation in the total pressure at large distances downstreamwithout introducing an appreciable gradient in static pressure nearthe grid .  a method of calculating a suitable arrangement of therods is described .  although this method is strictly applicableonly to weakly sheared flows, an experiment made with a griddesigned for a shear parameter as large as 0.45 gave results inclose agreement with the theory .  there was no evidence fromthe experiment of any large-scale secondary flow accompanyingthe shear--a danger inherent in an empirical attempt to grade theresistance of the grid--nor was any tendency observed for theshear to decay with increasing distance from the grid .
