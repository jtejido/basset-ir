the behaviour of non-linear systems ..Aclauser,f.h..Bj.aero. scs. 23, 1958, 411..Wthe behaviour of non-linear systems .  many of the phenomena that occur in the world around us aregoverned by nonlinear relationships .  in the development of themathematical sciences, the difficulties of nonlinear analysis havehindered the formulation of nonlinear concepts that wouldpermit us to understand such phenomena .  in the present article,our progress in understanding the behavior of nonlinear systemsis reviewed and an attempt is made to present the resultingconcepts in such a way that they may be applied with somegenerality to other problems .
