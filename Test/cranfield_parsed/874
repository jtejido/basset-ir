the use of models for the determination of critical flutter speeds ..Aduncan, w.j..Br + m 1425, july 1931 ..Wthe use of models for the determination of critical flutter speeds .the use of model tests in the prediction of full-scale critical flutterspeeds is now well established, and the technique of such tests istherefore worthy of discussion . in order to obtain critical speeds forthe model within the speed range of ordinary wind tunnels it isnecessary that the model should differ in some respect from a mere smallsuggested by mckinnon wood the modification of the model consists in areduction of its effective stiffnesses . this method has the defect /inmost cases probably not serious/ that the model experiment is conductedat a reynolds number much below that for full-scale . in the presentpaper it is pointed out that an alternative method of reducing thecritical speed is to increase the mass loading of the model and to makethe flutter tests in compressed air . * it is then quite feasible toreach the full-scale reynolds number . this method of reducing thecritical speeds by a proportionate increase of all effective densitiesmay also be combined with a reduction of the elasticity of the model .the relation of model and full-scale stresses at the critical flutterspeeds is considered . where the reduction in critical speed is effected by increase of density only, the model and full-scale stresses areequal . in a model of reduced elasticity the stresses in the wires arethe same as for full-scale,  whereas, the stresses in the spars are less than for full-scale . this is in accord with the usual experience thatthe wires of such a model are the first parts of the structure to failin a flutter .lastly, the influence of gravity on flutter is considered . this isnegligibly small for full-scale, but not necessarily so for the model .gravitational effects can sometimes be corrected by suitable orientation of the model .
