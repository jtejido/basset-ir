pressure distributions on three bodies of revolutionto determine the effect of reynolds number up to andincluding the transonic speed range ..Aswihart,j.m. and whitcomb,c.f..Bnaca rm l53h04, 1953..Wpressure distributions on three bodies of revolutionto determine the effect of reynolds number up to andincluding the transonic speed range .  this paper presents the results of an investigation conducted inthe langley 16-foot transonic tunnel to determine the effects of varyingreynolds number on the pressure distribution on a transonic body ofrevolution at angles of attack through the transonic speed range .  theeffect of a change in sting cone angle on the pressure distributionsand a comparison of experimental incremental pressures with theory isalso included .  the models were tested through a mach number range from 0.60 to 1.09 .the reynolds number range based on body length was from 9 x 10 to 39 xdiameter was 1.3 x 10 to 4.53 x 10 for the model at 8 angle of attack .  an increase in reynolds number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affectedthe longitudinal pressure distributions very slightly .  these effectswere of such a nature as to cause an increase of 0.05 in thenormal-force coefficient of the body when tested in the subcritical cross-flowreynolds number range .  this increase is in agreement with theoreticalapproximations .  a comparison between experimental and theoretical values of theincremental pressure coefficient due to angle of attack indicated goodagreement except at angles where separated flow areas existed over thebody .  the effect of a change in sting-cone angle from 5 to 9 on thepressure distribution of the 120-inch model was negligible up to amach number of 1.05 .  at this mach number the effect was to cause asmall increase in the velocity over the rear of the body .
