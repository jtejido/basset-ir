heat transfer to slender cones in hypersonic flow,including effects of yaw and nose bluntness ..Awittcliff,c.e. and wilson,m.r..Bj. ae. scs. 1962, 761..Wheat transfer to slender cones in hypersonic flow,including effects of yaw and nose bluntness .  as part of a general study of the aerothermodynamiccharacteristics of flight of hypersonic vehicles, an investigation oflaminar heat transfer to slender yawed cones has been conducted .experiments have been made in the cal 11- by 15-in. shocktunnel at mach numbers from 11 to 13 and at yaw angles up towere tested .  the heat-transfer rates are compared with theoreticalpredictions .  the effects on the local heat-transfer rates of theboundary-layer displacement thickness, transverse curvature, yaw,nose bluntness, and the entropy sublayer are discussed .  it isshown that, at zero yaw, the experimental data for the sharpcone are in good agreement with theory when boundary-layerdisplacement and transverse-curvature effects are included .for the yawed sharp cone, the heat-transfer rates along themost windward streamline are in good agreement with reshotko'stheory for yaw angles up to 3 .  at larger yaw angles, theexperimental heat transfer was found to be greater than thatpredicted theoretically .  however, at these yaw angles theheat-transfer distribution on the windward side was in goodagreement with laminar-boundary-layer calculations based on anassumption of local similarity .  the zero-yaw tests of the bluntedcones showed qualitative agreement with cheng's shock-layertheory for slender blunt-nose bodies .
