experiments with a tapered swept-back wing of warren 12 planform at mach numbers between 0.6 and 1.6 ..Ahall, i.m. and rogers, e.w.e..Ba.r.c. r + m 3271, part ii, july 1960 ..Wexperiments with a tapered swept-back wing of warren 12 planform at mach numbers between 0.6 and 1.6 .the development of the flow pattern on a wing of aspect ratio 2 828,taper ratio 0 333, leading-edge sweepback 53 5 deg and 6 per centthickness/chord ratio in the streamwise direction has been described inpart 1, which discussed oil-flow patterns obtained on the surface of the wing . the complete programme of tests also included pressure plottingat four spanwise stations and force measurements . these are discussedin relation to the flow development in this part of the report .the wing was tested at mach numbers between 0 6 and 1 6 for incidencesup to about 14 deg . the tunnel stagnation pressure was held constant ata value near atmospheric pressure during the tests, so that the reynolds number varied with mach number .. at m 1 0 it was 2 3 x 10 based on the mean aerodynamic chord . boundary-layer transition was fixed by aroughness band at the leading edge .a detailed analysis has been made of the pressure distributions on thesurface of the wing and the chordwise distributions integrated todetermine the spanwise loading . the overall lift and pitching moment of the wing were also obtained from these data, as well as from directmeasurements using a strain-gauge balance, by means of which the wingdrag was also determined . these results are considered in some detailto illustrate the effects of mach number and incidence on the flow about the model . a preliminary analysis is also made of the conditions forboundary-layer separation due to shock waves on the wing surface . theprincipal factor appears to be the component of mach number normal tothe shock front .
