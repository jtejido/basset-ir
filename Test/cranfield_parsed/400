buckling stress of clamped rectangular plates in shear ..Abudiansky,b. and connor,r.w..Bnaca tn.1559, 1948..Wbuckling stress of clamped rectangular plates in shear .  by consideration of antisymmetrical, as well as symmetrical,buckling configurations, the theoretical shear buckling stresses ofclamped rectangular flat plates are evaluated more correctly than inprevious work .  the results given, which represent the average of upperand lower-limit solutions obtained by the lagrangian multiplier method,are within percent of the true buckling stresses .
