unsteady aerodynamic forces on slender supersonic aircraftwith flexible wings and bodies ..Ayates,j.e. and zeydel,e.f.e..Baiaa jnl. 1, 1963, 350..Wunsteady aerodynamic forces on slender supersonic aircraftwith flexible wings and bodies .  the present paper derives generalized aerodynamicforces for slender supersonic aircraft onthe basis of slender-body theory .  particularconsideration is given to configurations whichare spanwise flexible .  to treat configurationswith flexible wings and bodies, the slenderwing-body problem is first reduced to a simple bodyproblem whose solution is well known, and asolution of the latter is obtained, utilizing thecircle theorem or method of images and a knownsolution of the airfoil equation for a doubleinterval .  with this approach, it is not necessaryto apply conformal mapping techniques,and the solution so obtained is valid for arbitraryspanwise downwash distributions .  on thebasis of slender-body theory, the velocity potentialand, subsequently, the generalizedaerodynamic forces are derived for a general class ofspanwise flexible wing-body configurations .
