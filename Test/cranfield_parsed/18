the flow field in the diffuser of a radial compressor ..Arhyming,i.l..Bj. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 798..Wthe flow field in the diffuser of a radial compressor .this note discusses the two-dimensional diffuser flow fieldin a radial compressor outside the impeller wheel .  it isassumed that the diffuser has guide vanes arranged in a circularrow at a radius .  the impeller wheel has the radius (seefig. 1) .  the flow in the diffuser starts at the circle with theradius .  the velocity components, and in the r anddirections of the velocity vector on this circle are prescribedtogether with the thermal state of the gas .  the flow so prescribedon the radius will, if no disturbances are present (i.e., noboundary conditions in the flow other than zero velocity atinfinity are to be fulfilled), develop in a spiral flow .
