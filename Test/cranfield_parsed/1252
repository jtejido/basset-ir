on the approach to chemical and vibrational equilibriumbehind a strong normal shock wave ..Adorrance,w.h..Bj. ae. scs. 161, 43..Won the approach to chemical and vibrational equilibriumbehind a strong normal shock wave .  the concurrent approach to chemical and vibrationalequilibrium of a pure diatomic gas passing through a strong normalshock wave is investigated .  it is demonstrated that theequilibrium degree of dissociation behind the shock front, and hence thedensity, for the case where the vibrational degrees of freedom arefrozen out can exceed the degree of dissociation, and hence thedensity, for the case where all degrees of freedom are inequilibrium .  thus the necessary condition for a maximum of thedensity between the shock front and the position of fullequilibrium flow downstream of the shock front is established .  thesufficient condition that such a maximum be observable is shownto be that the approach to equilibrium of the vibrational degreesof freedom (or any other internal degrees of freedom) must lagthe approach to dissociation equilibrium by a significant amount,.that is, there must be at least an order of magnitude difference inthe respective relaxation times before such a maximum might beobserved .  an example calculation for a mach 13 strong shockwave in oxygen illustrates the appearance of such a maximum ofthe density and its dependency upon the relative values of thevibration and dissociation relaxation times .
