the contraction of satellite orbits under the influenceof air drag . pt .iv with scale height dependent onaltitude ..Aking-hele,d.g., and cook,g.e..Brae tn.space 18, 1962..Wthe contraction of satellite orbits under the influenceof air drag . pt .iv with scale height dependent onaltitude .  the effect of air drag on satelliteorbits of small eccentricity ewas studied in part i (tech. notegw 533), on the assumption thatatmospheric density varies exponentiallywith distance r from the earth'scentre, so that the 'density scale height'h, defined as, isconstant .  in practice h varies with heightin an approximately linearmanner, and in the present note the theoryis developed for an atmospherein which h varies linearly with r .  equationsare derived which show howperigee distance and orbital period varywith eccentricity, and howeccentricity varies with time .  expressionsare also obtained for thelife-time and air density at perigee in termsof the rate of change of orbitalperiod .  the results are also presentedgraphically .  the results are formulated in twoways .  the first is to specify theextra terms to be added to the constant-hequations of part i .  the secondthe best constant value of h foruse with the equations of part i .  forexample, it is found that theconstant-h equations connecting perigeedistance (or orbital period) andeccentricity can be used unchanged withoutloss in accuracy, if h is takenas the value of the variable h at a heightabove the mean perigee heightduring the time interval being considered,where, anddecreases from to 0 as e decreasesfrom 0.02 to 0 .  similarly theconstant-h equations for air density atperigee can still be used if h isevaluated at a height above perigee,where, anddecreases to zero as e decreases fromconstant-h equations can still be usedif h is evaluated at the scale heightbelow the initial height .  variation ofh with altitude has a small effecton the lifetime - about 3 - and on thee-versus-time curve .
