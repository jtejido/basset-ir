random excitation of a tailplane section by jet noise ..Aclarkson,b.l. and ford,r.d..Buniv. southampton r. a.a.s.u.171..Wrandom excitation of a tailplane section by jet noise .  the response of a section of tailplane structure to both discreteand random noise pressures has been studied in detail .  initially thespecimen was mounted behind a jet engine and the induced strains wereanalysed with the object of determining both the resonant frequenciesand the corresponding modes of vibration .  during these tests a surveywas made of the spectrum and correlation pattern of the jet noise onthe surface of the model .  secondly the specimen was mounted in frontof a loudspeaker in an acoustics laboratory and the structuralresonances were excited by means of discrete frequency sound .  the modeshapes were studied in detail with the aid of a stroboscope .  it is concluded that the tailplane skin on this particular pieceof structure only responds to any significant degree in one structuralmode .  although reasonable comparison has been obtained between therandom and discrete tests, it was not possible to calculate the inducedstresses using the observed mode shapes and measured pressureexcitation .
