stagnation point heat transfer measurements in hypersoniclow density flow ..Aneice,s.e., rutkowski,r.w. and chann,k.k..Bj. ae. scs.27, 1960, 387..Wstagnation point heat transfer measurements in hypersoniclow density flow .in hypersonic, low reynolds number flow around a blunt body,the boundary-layer thickness approaches the shock-layerthickness (shock standoff distance) within the region ofcontinuum flow .  in this instance, the customary boundary-layerapproximations no longer apply .  hoshizaki and probsteinhave obtained solutions to the incompressible navier-stokesequations in the stagnation region of a blunt body in thishypersonic low reynolds number flow .  the results indicate thatheat-transfer rates are substantially higher than those predicted byincompressible boundary-layer theory .  probstein indicated thatthe actual heat-transfer rates would be correspondingly higherthan the predictions of fay and riddell .  these findings are ofparticular importance in the atmospheric entry phase ofrecoverable satellites .
