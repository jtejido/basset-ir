chemical kinetics of high temperature air ..Awray,k.l..Bhypersonic flow research, p 181, academic press, new york, 1962..Wchemical kinetics of high temperature air .  when a hypersonic object enters earth's atmosphere, a shockwave is formed in front of it, and the air passing through thisshock wave is heated to high temperatures .  the shock heatedmolecules equilibrate their translational and rotationaldegrees of freedom within a distance of a few mean free paths .to achieve equilibrium, it is necessary to excite vibration,dissociate molecules, produce new molecules and produce ionsand electrons .  the problem is complex, since all thesephenomena occur simultaneously and because the reaction rates dependon the temperature, density and composition which are changingduring the relaxation toward equilibrium .  the experimental techniques used to investigate thesereactions are briefly discussed along with the resulting rateexpressions obtained by the various investigators .  a compilationof the rate expressions for these reactions representing theauthor's evaluation of all the available data is presented .several pertinent problems which are not yet completelyunderstood and which still require theoretical and experimentalinvestigation are outlined .  computed concentration, temperatureand density time histories are shown for three different shockspeeds in air .  the time rate of change of concentration foreach chemical reaction is also shown and regimes of importancefor the various processes are discussed .
