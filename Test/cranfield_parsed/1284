the transition to tubulence in a boundary layer ona blunt cone in supersonic flow ..Arogers,r.h..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 501..Wthe transition to tubulence in a boundary layer ona blunt cone in supersonic flow .  experiments were made with a series of cones, each having anincluded angle of 15 degrees, and having different tip radii (sharpto blunt nose) .  the cones were tested in streams, undisturbedmach numbers of 3.12 and 3.81, and the position of transition toturbulence was observed with a shadowgraph technique .  for eachmach number the distance to transition (distance downstream fromthe tip of the cone) increased with increase in tip radius, reacheda maximum at a certain tip radius, and then decreased withincrease in tip radius .  a study indicates that a reynolds numberbased on the momentum thickness, instead of the length from tip totransition, is a more appropriate parameter for correlating the data .the research scientist active in this field probably would derivethe most benefit from the original paper .
