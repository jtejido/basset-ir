note on creep buckling of columns ..A.B.Wnote on creep buckling of columns .  the creep of a slightly crooked section column carrying aconstant load is studied theoretically .  the material of thecolumn is characterized by a strain-time relationship, underconstant uniaxial stress, of the form, where isthe total strain, is the constant stress, is the time, and e,a,b,and k are material constants .  this form was selected because itapplies to at least two alloys--75s-t6 aluminum alloy at 600 f .and a low-alloy steel at 800 and 1,100 f .  however, theanalysis is intended for any material having creep properties of thesame form and for which the material constants are known .  astrain-time relationship under variable uniaxial stress, necessaryfor the column analysis, is formulated from the constant-stressproperties with the aid of shanley's engineering hypotheses ofcreep .  the analysis leads to the conclusion that the lateral deflectionapproaches infinity--that is, the column collapses--in finite time .results are given showing the maximum length of time thecolumn can support a given load before it collapses and the growthof stresses, strains, and deflections prior to collapse .
