methods for estimating lift interference of wing-bodycombinations at supersonic speeds ..Anielsen,j.n. and kaattari,g.e..Bnaca til.2950..Wmethods for estimating lift interference of wing-bodycombinations at supersonic speeds .  the modified slender-body methodused by nielsen, katzen, and tangin rm a50f06, 1950, to predict thelift and moment interference oftriangular wing-body combinations hasbeen adapted to combinations withother than triangular wings .  thatpart of the method for predicting theeffect of the body on the wing hasbeen retained, but a new method forpredicting the effect of the wing onthe body has been presented .  thesemethods have been applied to theprediction of the lift-curve slopes ofnearly 100 triangular, rectangular,and trapezoidal wing-bodyconfigurations .  the estimated and experimentalvalues for the lift-curve slopesagree for most of the cases within 10percent .  some of thehigher-order effects that must be taken intoaccount in a theory that is togive greater accuracy than the presentone are discussed .  a numericalexample illustrating the method is included .
