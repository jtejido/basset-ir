viscous effects on pitot tubes at low speeds ..Amcmillan,f.a..Bj.roy.ae.s.58, 1954, 570..Wviscous effects on pitot tubes at low speeds .  measurements were made of the pressure in a blunt-nosed pitottube, in an air stream at reynolds numbers from about 15 to 1000 .the results are expressed in terms of a pressure coefficientdensity of the fluid, and p and v are the static pressure andvelocity in the undisturbed stream .  as found in previousinvestigations, becomes greater than 1 at low reynolds numbers, theincrease being about at a reynolds number of 50 (basedon external tube radius) .  in disagreement with the work of hurd,chesky, and shapiro, no decrease of below 1 was found at anyreynolds number .  when the values of found by various experiments areplotted against reynolds numbers based on internal tube radius,it is found that the curves are in closer agreement than when theexternal radius is used .
