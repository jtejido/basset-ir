further developments of new methods in heat flow analysis ..Abiot,m.a..Bj.ae.scs.26, 1959..Wfurther developments of new methods in heat flow analysis .  lagrangian methods in heat-flow problems and transportphenomena were introduced by the writer in some previous work .the present paper develops further one particular aspect of themethod,--i.e., the elimination of /ignorable coordinates ./  thisis accomplished by a special choice of generalized coordinates,each of which is constituted by an arbitrary temperaturedistribution and an /associated flow field ./  the latter is a vectorfield which is derived from the corresponding scalar field by avariational method .  the procedure is valid for a certain class ofnonlinear problems, provided we replace the temperature by the heatcontent as the unknown .  it is shown that for normal coordinatesderivation of the associated flow field is immediate .  the useof normal coordinates and their associated flow fields isillustrated by an example .  introduction of dirac functions andassociated flow fields yields a procedure which constitutes ageneralization of the classical formulation by green's functionsand integral equations .  this is illustrated by application toone-dimensional problems of heating of a homogeneous or compositeslab and directly verified by classical methods in the appendix .
