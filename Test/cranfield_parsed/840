analysis of partly wrinkled membrane ..Astein,m. and hedgepeth,j.m..Bnasa tn.d813, 1961..Wanalysis of partly wrinkled membrane .  a theory is derived to predict the stresses and deformations ofstretched-membrane structural components for loads under which part ofthe membrane wrinkles .  rather than studying in detail the deformationsin the wrinkled region, the present theory studies average displacementsof the wrinkled material .  specific solutions of problems in flat andcurved membranes are presented .  the results of these solutions showthat membrane structures retain much of their stiffness at loadssubstantially above the load at which wrinkling first occurs .
