an investigation of the use of an auxiliary slot tore-establish laminar flow on low drag aerofoils ..Acumming,r.w., gregory,b. and walker,w.s..Barc r + m.2742, 1950..Wan investigation of the use of an auxiliary slot tore-establish laminar flow on low drag aerofoils .  the use of an auxiliary slot on a laminar-flowaerofoil has been investigated to check whether laminarflow can be re-established by suction at the rear of the regionof deposited dirt, flies, etc .  results indicate that in the absence of unfavourable pressuregradients, it is possible to re-establish a laminarboundary layer by removing a little more than the whole turbulentlayer reaching the slot, and preliminary estimatessuggest that with efficient ducting it should be possible to achievea reduction in overall effective drag coefficient bythis means .
