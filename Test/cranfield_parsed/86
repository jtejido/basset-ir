inviscid-incompressible flow theory of static peripheraljets in proximity to the ground ..Astrand,t..Bj. ae. scs. 1961, 27..Winviscid-incompressible flow theory of static peripheraljets in proximity to the ground .  an /exact/ flow theory of peripheral jets issuingsymmetrically from a hovering aerial-ground vehicle is presented .  thetheory is exact insofar as no simplifying assumptions have beenmade in obtaining a solution of the governing inviscid,two-dimensional hydrodynamical flow equations .  the results arevalid for all jet thickness vehicle height ratios .  the limit ofapplicability of existing theories (very low thickness heightratios) are defined .  jet reaction, lift, and power coefficients forstatic conditions are introduced and computed .  liftaugmentation and lift power ratios are also calculated .  applications to three-dimensional vehicles with rotationalsymmetry are indicated .
