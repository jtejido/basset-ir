the ground effect on the jet flap in two dimensions ..Ahuggett,d.j..Barc 19,713, 1957..Wthe ground effect on the jet flap in two dimensions .  this paper presents the results of the first part of anexperimental investigation of the ground effect on simple jet flapaerofoils .  in this part of the work an aerofoil having a 58.1 deg jetflap was tested under two-dimensional conditions .  the pressure lift on the aerofoil was measured, with the groundat fixed positions, for varying jet momentum coefficients .  it wasfound that the effect of the ground on the pressure lift was very smallup to a certain critical jet coefficient .  on increasing the jetcoefficient beyond the critical value a marked loss of pressure lift wasobserved .  this critical value referred to is approximately the same asthe jet coefficient at which the jet first hits the ground .  some significant, though highly tentative comments, are maderegarding the practical application of this work to the take-offcharacteristics of a jet flapped aircraft .
