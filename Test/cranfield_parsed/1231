hypersonic flow over an elliptic cone: theory and experiment ..Achapkis,r.l..Bj. ae. scs. 1961, 844..Whypersonic flow over an elliptic cone: theory and experiment .  by applying hypersonic approximations to ferri's linearizedcharacteristics method, simple results were obtained for theshock shape and surface pressure distribution for an unyawedconical body of arbitrary cross section .  calculations werecarried out for an elliptic cone having a ratio of major to minoraxes of, and a semivertex angle of about 12 in the meridianplane containing the major axis .  an experimental investigationof the flow over this body conducted at a mach number of 5.8in the galcit hypersonic wind tunnel showed that the surfacepressure distribution at zero angle of attack agreed quite closelywith the theoretical prediction .  on the other hand, the simplenewtonian approximation predicts pressures that are too low .  surface pressure distributions and schlieren photographs ofthe shock shape were obtained at angles of attack up to 14 atzero yaw, and at angles of yaw up to 10 at zero pitch .  at thehigher angles of attack the newtonian approximation for thesurface pressures is quite accurate .
