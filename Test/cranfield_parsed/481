mass transfer cooling of a laminary boundary layerby injection of a light weight foreign gas ..Aeckert,e., schneider,p., hayday,a. and larson,r..Bjet prop. 1958, 34..Wmass transfer cooling of a laminary boundary layerby injection of a light weight foreign gas .  analytical predictions are given for the development ofthe velocity, temperature and concentration fields in alaminar air boundary layer on a flat plate in high-speeddissipative flow, the plate being considered porous andcooled by injection of hydrogen from its surface .  theadmixture of hydrogen, having a low density and highthermal capacity relative to air, is shown to greatlydiminish the skin friction and to markedly relieve theadverse thermal effects of intense aerodynamic heating underconditions of hypersonic flow .
