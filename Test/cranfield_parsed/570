on the boundary layer equations in hypersonic flowand their approximate solutions ..Alees,l..Bj. ae. scs. 20, 1953, 143..Won the boundary layer equations in hypersonic flowand their approximate solutions .  analytical solutions of the prandtl boundary-layer equations areobtained for the problem of the /strong/ interaction between theleading-edge shock and the viscous layer over a flat plate at hypersonicvelocities .  as the mach number increases and the interaction regionspreads downstream over the plate, the local skin-friction coefficientincreases rapidly over its conventional value .  the local heat-transfercoefficient at first remains practically unaffected but then also beginsto increase with mach number .
