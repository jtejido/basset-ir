reduction of the clamped plate to two membrane problemswith an application to uniformly loaded sectors ..Amorley,l.s.d..Brae r.struct.277, 1962..Wreduction of the clamped plate to two membrane problemswith an application to uniformly loaded sectors .  the clamped plate problem inthe classical theory for the smalldeflection bending of flat platesis reduced to the solution by variationalmethods of two successive membraneproblems .  the first requires the leastsquare minimisation of the averagecurvature of the deflected surface whilethe second problem concerns theintegral of the gaussian curvature .  thereis a similar reduction for extensionalproblems where the boundary tractionsare specified .  the method is demonstrated bygiving three distinct solutions to theproblem of the clamped sector undera uniformly distributed load .  onesolution is of special interest becauseit is derived from a single membraneproblem .  numerical data are given .
