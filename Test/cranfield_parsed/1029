note on creep buckling of columns ..A.B.Wnote on creep buckling of columns .  a variational theorem is presented for a body undergoingcreep .  solutions to problems of the creep behavior of plates,columns, beams, and shells can be obtained by means of thedirect methods of the calculus of variations in conjunction withthe stated theorem .  the application of the theorem isillustrated for plates and columns by the solution of two sampleproblems .
