shear buckling of clamped and simply-supported infinitelylong plates reinforced by transverse stiffeners ..Acook,i.t. and rockey,k.c..Baero. quart. 13, 1962, 41..Wshear buckling of clamped and simply-supported infinitelylong plates reinforced by transverse stiffeners .  the paper presents a solution to the buckling of infinitely longplates clamped along the edges, together with an extension of thesolution obtained by stein and fralich for the case when the edges aresimply-supported .  it is shown that, as a consequence of increasing theedge support from that of a simple support to one in which bothdeflection and rotation are prevented, the rigidity which anintermediate transverse stiffener must possess in order to support theplate effectively is much reduced .  agreement between the theoreticalrelationships and existing experimental data is good .
