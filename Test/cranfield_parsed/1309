hypersonic flows past a yawed circular cone and otherpointed bodies ..Acheng,h.k..Bj. fluid mech. 12, 1962, 169..Whypersonic flows past a yawed circular cone and otherpointed bodies .a detailed treatment of inviscid hypersonicflow past a circular cone is given, forsmall and moderate yaw angles, withinthe framework of shock-layer theory .the basic problem of non-uniform validityassociated with the singularity ofthe entropy field is examined and a validfirst-order solution is obtained whichprovides an explicit description of a thinvortical layer at the inner edge of theshock layer .  analytic formulas for pressureand circumferential velocity aregiven consistent to the second-orderapproximation including the non-linearyaw effect .  the study of the entropy field (whichis not restricted to the hypersonic case)also provides corrections to previouswork on the yawed cone and confirms thevalidity of the linear yaw effect on pressurefield in the stone theory .  a related investigation of three-dimensionalflow fields is presented withspecial reference to the flow structure nearthe surface of a pointed, butotherwise arbitrary body .  the inviscid streamlinepattern on the surface is given bythe geodesics originting from the pointednose as a leading approximation ofshock-layer theory .  associated with thisstreamline pattern is a vortical sublayerwhich exists generally at small as well as atlarge angle of attack .  at the base ofthe sublayer, enthalpy and flow speed remainessentially uniform .
