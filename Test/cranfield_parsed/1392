the solution of small displacement, stability or vibrationproblems concerning a flat rectangular panel when theedges are either clamped or simply supported ..Ahopkins,h.g..Barc r + m.2234, 1945..Wthe solution of small displacement, stability or vibrationproblems concerning a flat rectangular panel when theedges are either clamped or simply supported .  this report describes an energy method forthe exact solution of problems concerning the smalldisplacements, stability or vibration of a flat rectangular panelwhen the edges are either clamped or simply supported .the influence of stiffeners which are parallel to one pair of edges,and situated in pairs on opposite sides of the panelso that the neutral axis of each stiffener pair lies in the middlesurface of the panel, is taken into account .  the methodis not only applicable to isotropic panels but also to aeolotropicpanels when the material of the panel has two directionsof elastic symmetry parallel to the edges .  the final solution of the problems depends on an infinite set oflinear equations for small displacement problems or onan infinite determinantal equation for stability and vibrationproblems .  the important feature of the analysis given isthat it enables a direct approach to be made to these equationsin any particular problem .  it is not in general possibleto obtain a direct solution of the final equations and it isnecessary to approximate and consider a finite set of linearequations or a finite determinantal equation derived from themore important terms in the analytical expression for thetransverse displacement of the panel .  here, physical intuitionand, if available, experimental data serve as a guide andthe accuracy of the final results so obtained is gauged by therate of convergence with the increase in the number ofterms considered .  the general method of solution is applied first to the freevibration of a square panel when all the edges are clamped,and second to the buckling of a square panel under shear whenthree edges are clamped and one edge is simply supported .
