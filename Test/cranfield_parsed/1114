steady and fluctuating pressures at transonic speedson two space-vehicle payload shapes ..Acoe,c.f..Bnasa tm.x503, 1961..Wsteady and fluctuating pressures at transonic speedson two space-vehicle payload shapes .  steady and fluctuating pressureshave been measured at mach numberswhich were varied from 0.6 to 1.2 ontwo bodies of revolution typical oftwo space-vehicle payload shapes, thecentaur and the able v .  the results of the investigationshowed that significant fluctuationsof pressure occurred on both bodiesbetween mach numbers of 0.75 and 1.00 .the maximum fluctuations measured atany mach number and angle of attackoccurred in the region of the normalshock wave as a result ofshock-wave motion .  large regions of unsteadypressure also occurred as a resultof separation on the converging afterbodyof the able-v model .  the maximumpressure fluctuations occurring on thebodies increased with increasingangle of attack .  for angles other thanare indicated since pressure fluctuationswere larger on the upper halfof the bodies than on the lower half .  no definite conclusions could bedrawn regarding the form of thespectral densities of pressurefluctuations in the region of the shockwave .  the spectral densities in regionsof separation following theshock wave appeared flat except for someincrease in energy level belowdue to slight model motions .
