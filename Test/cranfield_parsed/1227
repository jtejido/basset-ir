pressure-gradient effects on the preston tube in supersonicflow ..Analeid,j.f. and thompson,m.j..Bj. ae. scs. 1961, 940..Wpressure-gradient effects on the preston tube in supersonicflow .  this paper is concerned with an experimental investigation ofthe effects of a longitudinal pressure gradient in a supersonicstream of air over a bounding surface on the performance of apreston or impact-pressure tube at the surface .  evidence ispresented which indicates that for the mach number considered andfor the range of pressure gradients covered, the preston tubefunctions in a completely satisfactory manner for the determinationof local shear stress .
