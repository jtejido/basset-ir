post-buckling behaviour of axially compressed circularcylinder shells ..Akempner,j..Bj. ae. scs. 21, 1954, 329..Wpost-buckling behaviour of axially compressed circularcylinder shells .  the postbuckling characteristics of an axially compressedthin-walled circular cylindrical shell loaded either by dead weightsor by a rigid testing machine are determined .  it is shown thatfor either loading condition the minimum applied stress in thepostbuckling region is 0.182(er) and that the region of stableequilibrium corresponding to loading by the rigid testing machineincludes and extends beyond that obtained with dead weightloading .  the work here described is a continuation of work doneearlier by von karman and tsien, by michielsen, and by leggettand jones .
