latitude and diurnal variations of air densities from 190 to 280 km.as derived from the orbits of discoverer satellites ..Agroves, g.v..Bproc. roy. soc. a. 263. 212-216. 1961 ..Wlatitude and diurnal variations of air densities from 190 to 280 km.as derived from the orbits of discoverer satellites .variations in air density between day and night in the region 190 to 280 km are found to be small/less than about 25(/ . the presence of apossible region of local heating at about 220 km which disappears atnight . the night-time density profile conforms with a constant scaleheight of 35/2/km.no definite variation of air density with latitude isevident apart from a possible increase of about 60(, which is indicatedby rather limited polar-region data . for other latitudes and seasons avariation of less than about 20( is indicated .
