free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic ..A.B.Wfree-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .  this report presents equations, tables, and figures for use in theanalysis of helium flow at supersonic and hypersonic speeds .  thecontents of the report and presentation of the data parallel that of asimilar reference work (naca rep. 1135) prepared for air flow .  the perfect-gas relations for continuous one-dimensional flow,normal- and oblique-shock waves, and prandtl-meyer expansions are thesame as for air but are presented here for completeness .  the tablespresent the values of useful dimensionless ratios for continuousone-dimensional flow and for normal-shock waves as functions of machnumber .  the helium viscosity relation as a function of temperature,mass-flow rates as a function of mach number and temperature, and thereynolds number as a function of mach number and stagnation temperatureare plotted .  the oblique-shock characteristics of wedges and cones inhelium at mach numbers of 12, 16, 20, and 24 are presented in a seriesof plots .  throughout all the computations, helium is considered to bea perfect gas .
