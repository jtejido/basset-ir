a simple method for calculating the span and chordwise loading onstraight and swept wings of any aspect ratio at subsonic speeds ..Akuchemann, d..Br + m 2935, r.a.e. rep. aero. 2476, a.r.c. 15,633. august 1962 ..Wa simple method for calculating the span and chordwise loading onstraight and swept wings of any aspect ratio at subsonic speeds .the methods of the classical aerofoil theory are used to derive ageneral theory for wings of any given planform . the load over thewhole surface of a given wing can be calculated at a given subcriticalmach number, and the procedure is as simple and rapid as that of theclassical aerofoil theory . the calculated results are confirmed byexperiments .
