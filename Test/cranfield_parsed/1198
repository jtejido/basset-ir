the blunt-leading-edge problem in hypersonic flow ..Aoguchi,h..Baiaa jnl. u, 1963, 361..Wthe blunt-leading-edge problem in hypersonic flow .  the present paper is mainly concerned withthe hypersonic flow over a flat plate with ablunt nose .  the analysis is based on the flowmodel in which the flow field behind the shockwave may be divided into two regions ..  theinviscid-hypersonic-flow region and the entropylayer, across which the pressure has no appreciablechange .  the equations for the entropylayer can be reduced to those of the usualboundary-layer problem with the exception thatthe outer edge of the entropy layer, as wellas the pressure remain unknown .  theseunknowns are determined so as to approximatelymatch the entropy-layer solution with theinviscid hypersonic solution in which the shockwave has the shape of the power law of thedistance from the leading edge .  the assumedflow model is shown to be valid over a restrictedrange depending on the wall-to-stagnationtemperature ratio and (where isthe reynolds number based on half the thicknessof nose t, m the freestream mach number,and c the chapman-rubesin constant .actual calculations have been carried out for thecase with typical values of andthe wall-to-stagnation temperature ratio .the calculated values for both the surfacepressure and heat-transfer rate are comparedwith the experimental data .  as regards surfacepressure in particular, a satisfactoryagreement with the data is obtained .  the validityof the assumptions upon which the presentanalysis is based has been examined from thenumerical results, and the region of the validityhas been found to extend over a certain large rangeof the nondimensional distance from theleading edge .
