the design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on webplates subjected to shear ..Arockey,k.c..Baero. quart. 1956, 275..Wthe design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on webplates subjected to shear .  the correct design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on web platessubjected to shear becomes very important whenthe web plates are designedto operate at loads close to their buckling loads .this paper presents detailsof an extensive series of tests conducted onstiffened web plates subjected toshear .  from the analysis of the results obtainedfrom these tests, new empiricalrelationships between the flexural rigidity andspacing of the intermediatestiffeners and the buckling stress of the stiffenedweb plate have been obtained .  one interesting and important feature ofthese new relationships is thatthey define more clearly than hitherto the differencein the behaviour ofsingle-and double-sided stiffeners .
