approximate methods fore predicting separation propertiesof laminar boundary layers ..Acurle,n. and skan,s.w..Baero. quart. 8, 1957, 257..Wapproximate methods fore predicting separation propertiesof laminar boundary layers .  some new solutions for steady incompressible laminar boundarylayer flow, obtained by gortler, have been used to test the accuracy oftwo methods which are commonly used to predict separation .  amodification of stratford's criterion for separation is given in thispaper and is probably the most accurate and the simplest of all methodsat present in use .  modified numerical functions are also given forthwaites's method of predicting the main characteristics of the boundarylayer over the whole surface, which improve the accuracy of the method .
