a graphical approximation for temperatures and sublimation rates atsurfaces subjected to small net and large gross heat transfer rates ..Aadams, e. w..Bj. aero. sc. v. 29, march 1962, pp. 360-1 ..Wa graphical approximation for temperatures and sublimation rates atsurfaces subjected to small net and large gross heat transfer rates .considers a material, acted upon by heat of conduction, which changesits state by sublimation at the heated surface . the derived method ismost suitable under conditions of severe heating such as space vehiclere-entry .
