wind tunnel techniques for the measurements of oscillatoryderivatives ..Abratt, j.b..Barc 22, 146, 1960.Wwind tunnel techniques for the measurements of oscillatoryderivatives .this paper discusses the basic principles employed in techniques for the measurement of oscillatory derivatives in wind tunnels, and gives someaccount of the associated instrumentation . the suitability of thevarious techniques for different test conditions is also discussed andbrief reference is made to wind tunnel effects on the measurements .
