bending of a square plate with two adjacent edges freeand the others clamped or simply supported ..Aleissa,a.w. and niedenfuhr,f.w..Ba.i.a.a. jnl. 1, 1963, 116..Wbending of a square plate with two adjacent edges freeand the others clamped or simply supported .  the title problems were solved for the two cases ..  (1) uniformtransverse loading, (2) a concentrated force at the free corner .  afunction is chosen to exactly satisfy the biharmonic equationwhile the boundary conditions are enforced at a number of pointsplied at discrete points around the boundary for each of the fourproblems and the resulting 35 simultaneous equations were solvedon an ibm 704 .  tables listing the values of deflection andbending moments are presented .  this paper provides useful informationon the solution of these problems which are intractable byanalytical methods .
