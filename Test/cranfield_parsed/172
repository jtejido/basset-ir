some aerodynamic considerations of nozzle afterbodycombination ..Acortright,e.m..Baero. eng. rev. 15, 1956, 59..Wsome aerodynamic considerations of nozzle afterbodycombination .  the aerodynamic problems associated withpropulsion-system installations have assumed a roleof vital importance in the development of supersonicaircraft .  although air-induction systems have receivedmoderate attention in the literature, considerably lessinformation can be found on the design and installationof turbojet exit nozzles .  this condition should not beinterpreted to indicate a lack of problems in jet-exitdesign .  as flight speeds reach supersonic levels, it becomesincreasingly difficult to achieve nozzle installationswhich are efficient over the entire speed range .  thedifficulties largely stem from the fact that the goals ofhigh jet thrust and low afterbody drag are not alwayscompatible .  in many of the compromise solutions, itis generally unsatisfactory to examine isolated nozzleand afterbody performance .  rather they must betreated as a unit, and the complex effects of jetinteraction with the external stream must be taken intoaccount .  to accomplish this, the nozzle and air-framedesigners must closely coordinate their efforts .  some of the aerodynamic problems of nozzleafterbody combinations are outlined in this report .particular attention is devoted to the influence of thejet-stream interaction on both nozzle thrust andafter-body drag .  for this purpose, use is made of shock-boundary-layer-interaction concepts .  this approach,although not precise, correctly predicts many trendsand is generally enlightening .
