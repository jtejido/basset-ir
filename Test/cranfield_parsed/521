a note on application of transonic linearization toan airfoil with a round leading edge ..Ahosokawa,i..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 1395..Wa note on application of transonic linearization toan airfoil with a round leading edge .the profile of a symmetric airfoil of unit length with a roundleading edge can be expressed, in general, aswhere p(x) has a finite slope at x = 0 .  it is well known thatthe conventional sub- and supersonic linear theories ofcompressible flow break down in the neighborhood of such a roundleading edge due to the failure of the small-disturbanceassumption .  the linearized transonic flow theory has the sameshort-coming, but if the determination of the sonic point on the airfoilplays an important role in any more advanced theory--e.g.,spreiter's local-linearization method or hosokawa's method ofrefinement--this theoretical barrier will become more seriousbecause the sonic point is usually located in a flow region nearthe leading edge that may be greatly affected by the roundness .
