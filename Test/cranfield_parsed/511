tunnel tests on a double cascade to determine the interactionbetween the rotor and the nozzles of a supersonic turbine ..Astratford,b.s..Bngte m359..Wtunnel tests on a double cascade to determine the interactionbetween the rotor and the nozzles of a supersonic turbine .  experimental confirmation has been required that in a supersonicturbine the leading edges of the rotor governs the rotor incidence and,hence, the gas exit angle from the nozzles .  evidence has also beenrequired that, once the rotor incidence has been allowed for, there isno adverse effect of the rotors on the nozzle flow, even when the rotorshave a large turning angle .  the present test cascade represented the stationary configurationof a turbine of 2.5 nozzle mach number and 74 swirl angle, the rotorsbeing designed to operate at 1.9 relative mach number and to provide aturning angle of 140 .  in the tests, fully supersonic flow could beestablished through the system, but the losses were fairly high and anincrease in loss of about 25 per cent would have caused choking in therotor .
