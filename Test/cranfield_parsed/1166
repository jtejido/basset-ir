an investigation to determine conditions under whichdownwash from vtol aircraft will start surface erosionfrom various types of terrain ..Akuhn,r.e..Bnasa tn.d56, 1959..Wan investigation to determine conditions under whichdownwash from vtol aircraft will start surface erosionfrom various types of terrain .  results of an investigation withsmall-scale equipment of theconditions under which the downwash froma hovering vertical-take-off-and-landing (vtol) aircraft will startsurface erosion indicate that theonset of erosion depends only on thedynamic pressure of the outwardflow of air near the surface .  for arotor or propeller at a height ofabout 1 slipstream diameter above thesurface, this surface dynamicpressure was found to be equal to thedisk loading .  for the vtolaircraft supported by a ducted fan, thesurface dynamic pressure with theducted fan exit at a height of aboutone-half the exit-area loading .  thesurface dynamic pressure decreasesrapidly with increasing height of thevtol device .  erosion of sand and loose dirtstarted at surface dynamic pressuresof 1 to 3 lb sq ft, which is in generalagreement with helicopterexperience .  thoroughly soaking the sand andloose-dirt surfaces increased theresistance to erosion to surface dynamicpressures of 30 to 50 lb sq ft .spray from water started at surfacedynamic pressures of 1.5 topressures up to about 1,000 lb sq ft .
