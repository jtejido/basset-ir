the prospects for magneto-aerodynamics ..Aresler,e.j. and sears,w.r..Bj. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 235..Wthe prospects for magneto-aerodynamics .  the equations describing the flow of an electrically conductingfluid in the presence of electric and magnetic fields are writtendown with the aid of certain simplifications appropriate toaeronautical applications .  in order to estimate the probablesignificance of magneto-aerodynamic effects, some data onconductivity of pure and /seeded/ air are first examined .dimensionless quantities representing the ratios of forces and ofcurrents are then formed and their values studied for conditionsof flight in the atmosphere .  some examples of magneto-hydrodynamic and magneto-gasdynamic effects in simple flows are given .  these includetwo cases of poiscuille flow of conducting liquids with appliedmagnetic fields and the case of quasi-one-dimensional gas flowwith applied electrical and magnetic fields .  in the last case,attractive possibilities are found for controlled acceleration ordeceleration of gas at subsonic and supersonic speeds, even inconstant-area channels .  the behavior of the flow ischaracteristically different in different regimes of mach number and flowspeed relative to certain /significant speeds/ that are dependenton the ratio of electrical to magnetic field strengths .  theseare studied, and a chart is constructed to relate the length tothe speed ratio of a maximum-acceleration constant-area channel .  it is concluded that the advantages that may accrue frommagneto-aerodynamic methods are sufficiently attractive tojustify the considerable research and engineering developmentthat will be required .  among the unsolved engineering problemsare the reduction of surface resistance of electrodes in contactwith a conducting gas, development of techniques for seeding,and provision of the required magnetic fields in flight .
