viscous hypersonic similitude ..Ahayer,w.d. and probstein,r.f..Bj. ae. scs. 26, 1959, 815..Wviscous hypersonic similitude .  an extension of classical hypersonic similitude is developedwhich takes into account the interaction effect of thedisplacement thickness of the boundary layer .  a basic result of thisviscous similitude is that the total drag including frictional dragobeys the classical similarity law for the pressure drag .additional similarity conditions governing viscous effects must beimposed in this similitude .  underlying the similitude is a new hypersonic boundary-layerindependence principle .  according to this principle, theprincipal part of a hypersonic boundary layer with given pressureand wall temperature distributions and free-stream totalenthalpy is independent of the (high) external mach numberdistribution outside the boundary layer .  various features of viscous hypersonic similitudes arediscussed .  it is found, for example, that it applies to three-dimensional boundary-layer interaction effects on flat bodies, providedthe concepts of strip theory may be applied, and provided theaspect ratio is an invariant .
