heat transfer to flat plate in high temperature rarefiedultra-high mach number flow ..Anagamatsu,h.t., weil,h.a. and sheet,r.e..Bars j. 32, 1962, 533..Wheat transfer to flat plate in high temperature rarefiedultra-high mach number flow .  an investigation was conducted in a hypersonicshock tunnel to determine the local heat transferrates for a sharp leading edge flat plate .  the freestream mach number range was 7.95 to 25.1 withstagnation temperatures of approximately 2550and 6500 r .  for these temperature and machnumber conditions, the strong interaction parameter,varied from 2.35 to 826 .  thecorresponding knudsen numbers, based on theratio of the free stream mean free path and theleading edge thickness, varied from 0.38 to 85.5 .for free stream mach numbers greater than 10,knudsen numbers of approximately unity, andperfect gas conditions, the calculated heat transfercoefficients were found to vary as as predictedby the noninsulated flat plate theory of liand nagamatsu .  for the case of,the leading edge slip phenomenondrastically reduced the local heat transfer coefficientsas compared to the theoretical values predictedwith no slip at the surface .  for the extreme case of and,the measured localheat transfer rate was an order of magnitudeless than the analytical value .  both the knudsennumber and the free stream mach number areimportant physical parameters that determine theextent of the slip-flow region .
