theory of aircraft structural models subjected to aerodynamicheating and external loads ..Ao'sullivan,w.j..Bnaca tn.4115, 1957..Wtheory of aircraft structural models subjected to aerodynamicheating and external loads .  the problem of investigating the simultaneous effects of transientaerodynamic heating and external loads on aircraft structures for thepurpose of determining the ability of the structure to withstand flightto supersonic speeds is studied .  by dimensional analyses it is shownthat ..constructed of the same materials as the aircraft will be thermallysimilar to the aircraft with respect tothe flow of heat through the structurewill be similar to those of the aircraft when the structural model isconstructed at the same temperature as the aircraft .external loads will be similar to those of the aircraft .subjected to heating and cooling that correctly simulate the aerodynamicheating of the aircraft, except with respect to angular velocities andangular accelerations, without requiring determination of the heat fluxat each point on the surface and its variation with time .acting on the aerodynamically heated structural model to those actingon the aircraft is determined for the case of zero angular velocity andzero angular acceleration, so that the structural model may be subjectedto the external loads required for simultaneous simulation of stressesand deformations due to external loads .
