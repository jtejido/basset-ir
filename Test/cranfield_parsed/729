stresses in continuous skin stiffener panels under random loading ..Alin, y.k..Bj. aero. sc. january 1962 ..Wstresses in continuous skin stiffener panels under random loading .theoretical aspects involved in the prediction of stress levels forcontinuous skin-stiffener panels subjected to a random pressure fieldare considered in the light of powell's general theory for statisticalsuperposition of modal response . the choice of structural model isdictated by the prevalence of skin-stiffener construction in modernflight vehicle design . the present study clearly demonstrates that anytruly adequate prediction of stress levels in actual aircraft structures requires a much better representation of structural characteristicsthan can be provided by single panel idealizations . in an exampleconsidering fuselage panels exposed to jet engine noise, essentialagreement is shown with experimental data, although better correlation isshown for rms stress than for power spectrum . it is shown thatreduction of stress level by increasing damping is effective only in thehigher frequency range .
