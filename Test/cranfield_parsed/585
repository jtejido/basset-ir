nonlinear heat transfer problem ..Achambre,p.l..Bj. app. phys. 30, 1959, 1683..Wnonlinear heat transfer problem .  a study has been made of the time-dependent heatconduction in a semi-infinite medium subject to aboundary condition which can involve the temperaturein a nonlinear manner .  a formulation for thedetermination of the surface temperature, which is oftenof greatest physical interest, leads to a nonlinearvolterra integral equation .  a simple iterative solutionmethod, with an accuracy suitable for many practicalpurposes is presented .  as an example, the problemof the time-dependent surface temperature of a bodyreceiving heat according to the stefan-boltzmann lawis treated .  the analysis is also applicable to physicaladsorption or chemisorption processes which occur atthe boundary .
