an investigation of lifting effects on the intensityof sonic booms ..Amorris,j..Bj. roy. aero. soc. 64, 1960, 610..Wan investigation of lifting effects on the intensityof sonic booms .  this paper is a brief summary ofan investigation made to check the effect of lifton the shock noise of aircraft flying at supersonicspeeds .  the method of hayes has beencombined with the theory of whitham topredict the asymptotic shock strength of wingscarrying lift and of combinations of bodiesand lifting wings .  (a similar, but not quite asgeneral, method was derived by walkden inref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only thevolume term, has been used extensively to predictthe boom intensity of aeroplane type bodiesand the agreement with experiment has, so far,been quite reasonable .  the test data obtainedto date extends only up to about 40,000 ft.altitude and the calculations of this paper showthat under those conditions the shock noise ofthe aircraft tested so far will, in most cases,be dominated by the volume term .  it is shownthat at higher altitudes lifting effects willdominate for even the small fighter and they willdominate over most of the altitude rangefor large bomber and supersonic transportaircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreaseswith altitude as which compares toin the volume case (=pressure ataltitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number,wing loading, wing plan shape andlift distribution .  a simple rule for calculatingthe shock noise due to combined volume andlifting effects is proposed which is applicable toconfigurations with wings located towards therear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shocknoise of an aircraft carrying lift is equalto the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift)or the shock noise due to lift (neglectingvolume), whichever is the greater .  a chart ispresented from which rapid estimates can bemade of the shock noise of liftingwing-body combinations .
