recent studies on the effect of cooling on boundarylayer transition at mach 4..Awisniewski,r.j. and jack,j.r..Bj. ae. scs. 28, 1961..Wrecent studies on the effect of cooling on boundarylayer transition at mach 4.the advent of high-speed flight has necessitated the study ofboundary-layer transition on highly cooled bodies .investigations such as those of references 1-4 have concentratedon this problem and have indicated, contrary to the trendspredicted by small-disturbance theory, that premature transitioncan be found with cooling .  this phenomenon, commonly calleddetail in references 2-5 .  the purpose of this note is to report some recent transitiondata obtained on a cooled cone in a mach 4 wind tunnel .  themodel, a sharp-tip cone (included angle 13.5), was cooled byliquid nitrogen to a temperature of -340 f .  the coolingmethod and the data analysis are similar to that described inreference 3 .
