on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells ..Areissner,e..Bq. app. math., 13, 1955, 169..Won transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells .  according to marguerre (proc. 5th internat. congressappl. mech., cambridge, mass., 1938, wiley, new york,shells are governed by three simultaneous differentialequations in the three displacements .  the author hasconsiderably simplified this theory for the case of transversevibrations by ignoring the longitudinal inertia terms, thusreducing the problem to that of solving two simultaneousdifferential equations in a stress function and onedisplacement component .  this simplification is justified by anorder-of-magnitude analysis, and illustrated by considering thevibrations of a paraboloidal shell with a rectangularboundary .
