on the testing of supersonic compressor cascades ..Astaniforth,r..Bngte r212, 1957..Won the testing of supersonic compressor cascades .  to facilitate the development of high speed axial-flow compressors,an investigation was made into the possibility of measuring bladeperformance in a stationary cascade at supersonic speeds .  a suitabletechnique was developed and the losses in a variety of cascades weremeasured, but these losses were too high for the blading to have anypossible application .  it was concluded that if a useful compressor isto result, it is essential to test the cascades at mach numbers close tothe existing technique was suitable only for zero incidence tests, andthus a new approach is necessary .  some of the fundamentals of this cascade testing at low supersonicspeeds are discussed in the light of the current understanding of themode of operation of supersonic compressors at transonic speeds .
