knudsen flow through a circular capillary ..Aw. c. demarcus and e. h. hopper.Bcarbide and carbon chemicals company, k-25 plant, post office box p,oak ridge, tennessee.Wknudsen flow through a circular capillary .the problem of knudsen flow through a circular capillary has beenoften discussed, usually by the momentum transfer method .  however,p. clausing gave a rigorous formulation for the problem and obtained anintegral equation for which he gave an approximate solution .  fromtime to time the accuracy of clausing's solution has been questionedand since clausing did not give a rigorous estimate of his error wehave reinvestigated the problem .
