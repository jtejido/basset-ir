plastic stability theory of thin shells ..Agerard,g..Bj. ae. scs. 24, 1957..Wplastic stability theory of thin shells .  considerable interest is currently centered on therole of deformation and flow types of plasticitytheories in the solution of stability problems .  forthin flat plates, deformation theory combined withclassical stability theory appears to yield results whichare in substantially good agreement with test data .on the other hand, flow or incremental theories appearto require the introduction of initial imperfections inorder to obtain a satisfactory degree of correlation withtests .  thus, in view of the current state of development ofplastic stability theory, it appears fruitful to exploitthe mathematical simplicity inherent in deformationtheory in the investigation of the plastic stability ofthin shells .  although there may be theoreticalobjections to deformation theories as a class, test data onflat plates do suggest the predictive value of the resultsobtained from this theory .  in this paper, a set of equilibrium differentialequations for the plastic buckling of thin shells of constantunequal radii is derived .  this set of three equationsapplies to flat plates, cylinders, and spheres under anyloading system leading to buckling .  for particularproblems such as buckling of cylinders under axialcompression, torsion or lateral pressure, and spheresunder external pressure, the set of equations can bereduced to a single eighth-order partial differentialequation of the donnell type in terms of the radialdisplacement only .  these donnell-type equations areused to obtain solutions for plastic buckling of spheresunder external pressure and long and moderate lengthcylinders under lateral pressure or torsion loads .  thelimiting cases of a simply supported flat plate undercompression or shear, represent the solutions for shortcylinders under lateral pressure or torsion, respectively .
