an investigation of separated flows, part ii: flowin the cavity and heat transfer ..Acharwat,a.f..Bj. ae. scs. 28, 1961, 513..Wan investigation of separated flows, part ii: flowin the cavity and heat transfer .  the first portion of this paper describes studies of the internalstructure of the separated flow in a notch at a free-stream machnumber of 3 .  observations include..  flow visualization, spark-schlieren pictures of the fluctuations of the free shear layer, andstudies of the diffusion of heat from sources placed in theseparated region .  the second part describes measurements of localheat transfer to the wall .  the external mach number, the length-to-depth ratio of thecavity, the ratio of the oncoming boundary layer thickness to thenotch depth (in the turbulent flow region), the thermalto-momentum thickness ratio of the boundary layer and, finally,the geometry of the internal boundary of the separated regionare varied as systematically as possible .  on the basis of theseobservations, a simple model of the flow in and the heat transferacross the separated region is formulated .
