the effect of slip particularly for highly cooled walls ..Arott,n. and lenard,m..Bj. ae. scs. 1962, 591..Wthe effect of slip particularly for highly cooled walls .  it is found that for boundary conditions on the velocity slipand on the temperature jump which are not oversimplified in anunrealistic way, the effect of these phenomena on the heat transferand the shear at a stagnation point is of the order of the ratio ofthe mean free path outside the boundary layer to theboundary-layer thickness, even for highly cooled walls .  a simplifiedtheory of this effect is given, which puts the physical reasons forthe results in evidence and agrees closely with the more accuratecalculations .  it is concluded that the effects of slip and jumpare not negligible in comparison with other low-reynolds-numbercorrections, even for very cold walls .
