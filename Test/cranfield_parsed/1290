measured and calculated subsonic and transonic fluttercharacteristics of a 45 sweptback wing planform inair and in freon-12 in the langley transonic dynamicstunnel ..Ayates,e.c., land,n.s. and foughner,j.t..Bnasa tn.d1616, 1963..Wmeasured and calculated subsonic and transonic fluttercharacteristics of a 45 sweptback wing planform inair and in freon-12 in the langley transonic dynamicstunnel .  in order to investigate thereliability of flutter data measuredin the langley transonic dynamicstunnel, an experimental and theoreticalsubsonic and transonic flutter studyhas been conducted in air and infreon-12 in this facility .  the wingplanform employed had an aspectratio of 4.0, a taper ratio of 0.6,and 45 of quarter-chord sweepback .a sting-mounted full-span model wastested in addition to three sizes ofwall-mounted semispan models .  a widerange of mass ratio was covered bythe tests in air and by fluttercalculations made by the modifiedstrip-analysis method of naca researchmemorandum l57l10 .  a limited amount ofdata was obtained in freon-12 .  results of the tests in airand in freon-12 are in good agreementwith the flutter calculations atall mach numbers .  the test datacompare favorably with previouslypublished transonic flutter data for thesame wing planform .  the resultsindicate that flutter characteristicsobtained in freon-12 may be interpreteddirectly as equivalent flutterdata in air at the same mass ratio and mach number .
