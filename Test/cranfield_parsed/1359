compression tests on circular cylinders stiffened longitudinallyby closely spaced z-section stringers ..Apeterson,j.p. and dow,m.b..Bnasa memo. 2-12-59l, 1959..Wcompression tests on circular cylinders stiffened longitudinallyby closely spaced z-section stringers .  six circular cylinders stiffened longitudinally by closely spacedz-section stringers were loaded to failure in compression .  the resultsobtained are presented and compared with available theoretical resultsfor the buckling of orthotropic cylinders .  the results indicate thatthe large disparity that exists between theory and experiment forunstiffened compression cylinders may be significantly smaller forstiffened cylinders .
