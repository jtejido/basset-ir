approximate formulas for thermal-stress analysis ..Ad. j. johns.Blecturer, the college of aeronautics, cranfield, england.Wapproximate formulas for thermal-stress analysis .the basis of any thermal-stress analysis is the determination of thetemperature distributions in the structure .  for arbitrary flighthistories, the determination of such distributions is rather tediousand not completely general .  this latter fact handicaps optimizationstudies in the project design stage when it is desirable to be able toexpress the thermal-stress distributions in a general manner .in this note, general expressions are derived for the thermal-stressdistributions in a typical i-section using similar assumptions tothose of biot .
