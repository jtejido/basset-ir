effects on adjacent surfaces from the firing of rocket jets ..Abressette, w.e. and leiss, a..Bnaca rm l 57d19a, 1957 ..Weffects on adjacent surfaces from the firing of rocket jets .this paper is a preliminary and brief account of some research currently being conducted to determine the jet effects on adjacent surfaces fromthe firing of rocket jets . measurements of jet-effect pressures on aflat plate as well as shadowgraphs are presented that were obtained when a rocket jet at a mach number of 3 was exhausted downstream andupstream into free-stream flow at a mach number of 2 located from 2 to 4.7 rocket-jet-exit diameters from the plate . the jet effects on the flatplate with the rocket jet exhausting downstream are of the same order of magnitude as those previously obtained from sonic exits with a totalpressure 10 times lower . a maximum pressure coefficient on the plate ofrocket-jet-exit diameters below the plate, and an integration of themeasured jet-effect pressures at this position resulted in a normalforce on the plate equal to 2.3 times the thrust output of the rocketjet .
