laminar boundary layer behind shock advancing intostationary fluid ..Amirels,h..Bnaca tn.3401, 1955..Wlaminar boundary layer behind shock advancing intostationary fluid .  a study was made of the laminar compressible boundary layer inducedby a shock wave advancing into a stationary fluid bounded by a wall .for weak shock waves, the boundary layer is identical with that whichoccurs when an infinite wall is impulsively set into uniform motionshocks .  velocity and temperature profiles, recovery factors, andskin-friction and heat-transfer coefficients are tabulated for a wide rangeof shock strengths .
