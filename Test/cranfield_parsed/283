laminar heat transfer around blunt bodies in dissociatedair ..Akemp,n.h., rose,p.h. and detra,r.w..Bj.ae.sc. 26, 1959..Wlaminar heat transfer around blunt bodies in dissociatedair .  a method of predicting laminar heat-transfer rates to blunt,highly cooled bodies with constant wall temperature in dissociatedair flow is developed .  attention is restricted to the case ofaxisymmetric bodies at zero incidence, although two-dimensionalbodies could be treated the same way .  the method is based onthe use of the /local similarity/ concept and an extension of theideas used by fay and riddell .  a simple formula is given forpredicting the ratio of local heat-transfer rate to stagnation-pointrate .  it depends on wall conditions and pressure distribution,but not on the thermodynamic or transport properties of the hotexternal flow, except at the stagnation point .  experimental heat-transfer rates obtained with correctstagnation-point simulation and high wall cooling in shock tubes arealso presented and compared with the theoretical predictions .on the whole, the agreement is good, although in regions ofrapidly varying pressure there is evidence that the local similarityassumption breaks down, and the theory underestimates theactual heat-transfer rate by up to 25 per cent .
