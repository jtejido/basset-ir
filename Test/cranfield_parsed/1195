experiments with two-dimensional, transversely impinging jets ..Adosanjh,d.s. and sheerlan,w.j..Baiaa jnl. 1963, 1, 329..Wexperiments with two-dimensional, transversely impinging jets .  experiments on the interaction of transverselyimpinging two-dimensional jet flows wereperformed in which a low pressure control jetflow interacted with a relatively high pressurepower jet flow .  the ratio of the control jet tothe power jet supply chamber gauge stagnationpressure was adjusted at 0, 10, and 15 .shadowgraphs of the power jet alone, as well as thecorresponding interacting jet flows, wererecorded to establish the nature of and changes inthe shock structure .  the jet flows weretraversed by a pitot tube to record the pitot pressuredistributions at various locations downstreamof the power jet exit .  it was discovered thatwith the addition of only a small percentcontrol jet flow, the normal shock front of the highlyunderexpanded power jet flow changed toan oblique shock structure and, downstream of theprevious location of the normal shock whichappeared in the power jet flow alone, themaximum recovery stagnation pressures wereproportionally much higher .  the mechanism forthis behavior of the normal shock is proposed .possible practical importance of this behaviorof interacting jet flows with reference to aerodynamicnoise, supersonic diffuser losses, etc., isalso pointed out .  for the power jet flow alone itwas found that by considering the actual jetboundaries as simply an extension of the actualnozzle, the average axial flow quantities,computed from the area-mach number relation usingthe observed cross-sectional area of the jetflow, agreed quite favorably with the experimental results .
