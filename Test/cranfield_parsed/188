an analysis of base pressure at supersonic velocities andcomparison with experiment ..Achapman, dean r ..Bnaca report 1051.Wan analysis of base pressure at supersonic velocities andcomparison with experiment .   in the first part of the investigation an analysis is made ofbase pressure in an inviscid fluid, both for two-dimensional andaxially symmetric flow . it is shown that for two-dimensionalflow, and also for the flow over a body of revolution with acylindrical sting attached to the base, there are an infinitenumber of possible solutions satisfying all necessary boundaryconditions at anh given free-stream mach numger . for theparticular case of a body having no sting attached only onesolution is possible in an inviscid flow, but it corresponds tozero base drag . accordingly, it is concluded that a strictlyinviscid-flow theory cannot be satisfactory for practicalapplications .   an approximate semi-empirical analysis for base pressurein a viscous fluid is developed in a second part of theinvestigation . the semi-empirical analysis is based partly oninviscid-flow calculations . in this theory an attempt is made to allowfor the effects of mach number, reynolds number, profile shape,and type of boundary-layer flow . some measurements of basepressure in two-dimensional and axially symmetric flow arepresented for purposes of comparison . experimental resultsthen are presented concerning the support interference effectof a cylindrical sting, and the interference effect of a reflectedair wave on measurements of base pressure in a supersonic wind tunnel .
