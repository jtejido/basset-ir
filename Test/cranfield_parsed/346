measurements of turbulent friction on a smooth flat plate in supersonic ..A.B.Wmeasurements of turbulent friction on a smooth flat plate in supersonic .  direct measurements of supersonic local skin friction, using thefloating-element technique, are presented for mach numbers frombulent flow and transition are emphasized, although somemeasurements in the laminar regime are included .  the observed effectof compressibility is to reduce the magnitude of turbulent skinfriction by a factor of two at a mach number of 4.5 and areynolds number of about 10 .  the boundary-layer momentum-integral equation for constantpressure is verified within a few per cent by two experimentalmethods .  typical static pressure measurements are presented toshow that transition can be detected by observing disturbancesin pressure associated with changes in displacement thicknessof the boundary layer .  it is found that the turbulent boundary layer cannot be definedexperimentally for values of less than about 2,000, whereis the momentum thickness .  for larger values of there is aunique relationship between local friction coefficient andmomentum-thickness reynolds number at a fixed mach number .  theappendix compares the present measurements at m = 2.5 withexperimental data from other sources .
