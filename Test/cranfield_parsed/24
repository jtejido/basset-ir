theory of stagnation point heat transfer in dissociatedair ..Afay,j.a. and riddell,f.r..Bj. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 73..Wtheory of stagnation point heat transfer in dissociatedair .  the boundary-layer equations are developed in general for thecase of very high speed flight where the external flow is in adissociated state .  in particular the effects of diffusion and of atomrecombination in the boundary layer are included .  it is shownthat at the stagnation point the equations can be reduced exactlyto a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations even when thechemical reactions proceed so slowly that the boundary layer isnot in thermochemical equilibrium .  two methods of numerical solution of these stagnation pointequations are presented, one for the equilibrium case and theother for the nonequilibrium case .  numerical results arecorrelated in terms of the parameters entering the numericalformulation so as not to depend critically on the physical assumptionsmade .  for the nonequilibrium boundary layer, both catalytic (toatom recombination) and noncatalytic wall surfaces areconsidered .  a solution is represented which shows the transitionfrom the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombinationrates) to the equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates) .a recombination rate parameter is introduced to interpret thenonequilibrium results, and it is shown that a scale factor isinvolved in relating the equilibrium state of a boundary layer onbodies of different sizes .  it is concluded that the heat transfer through the equilibriumstagnation point boundary layer can be computed accurately bya simple correlation formula and that the heattransfer is almost unaffected by a nonequilibrium state of theboundary layer provided the wall is catalytic and the lewisnumber near unity .
