general characteristics of the flow through nozzlesat near critical speeds ..Asauer,r..Bnaca tm.1147, 1944..Wgeneral characteristics of the flow through nozzlesat near critical speeds .  the characteristics of the position and form ofthe transition surface through the critical velocityare computed for flow through flat and round nozzlesfrom subsonic to supersonic velocity .  correspondingconsiderations were carried out for the flow about profilesin the vicinity of sonic velocity .
