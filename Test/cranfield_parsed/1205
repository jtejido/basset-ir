effects of cooling on boundary layer transition ona hemi- sphere in simulated hypersonic flow ..Adunlap,r. and kuethe,a.m..Bj. ae. scs. 1962, 1454..Weffects of cooling on boundary layer transition ona hemi- sphere in simulated hypersonic flow .  an experimental investigation of the effects of cooling onboundary-layer transition on a 9-in. diameter hemisphere insimulated hypersonic flow is reported .  the newtonian pressuredistribution was obtained by use of a shroud and boundary layercooling was achieved by internally cooling the model .  transitionwas detected with hot wires and with a pitot tube at the surface .attained .  transition was observed in the subsonic and near-sonic flowregion at and upstream of n = 45 .  in this region the stagnationreynolds number at which transition occurred when the surfacewas highly polished was only slightly affected by cooling withinthe temperature range .  thus, transitionreversal does not occur on a polished spherical surface within therange of these tests, and we therefore conclude that the coolingdid not cause the linear stability of boundary layer to decreasesignificantly .  an essential feature of transition studies with boundary-layercooling is the close control of surface roughness .  in the presentexperiments this control required, in addition to a highly polishedsurface, the necessity for low water vapor dewpoint, theavoidance of carbon dioxide condensation and the utilzation of everyavailable means for removing the dust from the airstream .
