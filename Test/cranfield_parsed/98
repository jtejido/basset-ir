heat transfer by laminar flow to a rotating plate ..Amillsaps,k. and pohlhausen,k..Bj. ae. scs. 19, 1952, 120..Wheat transfer by laminar flow to a rotating plate .  an exact solution of the heat-transfer problem for the vonkarman example of the laminar flow of a viscous fluid over arotating plate is given in dimensionless form and physicallydiscussed .  the solution is explicitly given for a constanttemperature on the plate with viscous dissipation included .  thenumerical results are given for prandtl numbers from 0.5 to 10 .
