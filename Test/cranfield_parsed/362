three-dimensional effect of flutter in a real fluid ..Awen-hwa chu.Bsenior research engineer, department of mechanical sciences,southwest research institute, 8500 culebra road, san antonio 6, texas.Wthree-dimensional effect of flutter in a real fluid .in ref. 1, an alternative semi-empirical formulation for flutter in areal fluid is given .  for more accurate determination of the empiricalcoefficients, the three-dimensional effect of finite span should betaken into account . following reissner's approximation forlarge-aspect-ratio rectangular wings, the boundary-value problem governing thedownwash w and the vorticity distribution .
