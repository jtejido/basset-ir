compressible free shear layer with finite initial thickness ..Adenison,m.r. and baum,e..Baiaa jnl. 1, 1963, 342..Wcompressible free shear layer with finite initial thickness .  the momentum equation was uncoupled fromthe other conservation equations for the caseof a finite initial profile in a laminar free shear layer .the equation was solved numerically, inthe crocco coordinate system, using an implicitfinite difference method .  profiles of velocityand shear function were obtained as a function ofstreamwise distance .  the initial profiles asthe flow separates from the rear of the bodycorrespond to the blasius profile in transformedcoordinates .  for large distances downstream,the profiles approach the chapmandistribution, corresponding to the case of zero initialfree shear layer thickness .  the effect of theseresults on calculations of base pressure and wakeangle is discussed .  a method for thecalculation of finite chemical kinetic effects on theprofiles of temperature and chemicalcomposition in the free shear layer with finite initialthickness is outlined .
