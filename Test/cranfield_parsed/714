blockage corrections for three-dimensional flow closedthroat wind tunnels, with considerations of the effectof compressibility ..Aherriot,j.g..Bnaca r.995, 1950..Wblockage corrections for three-dimensional flow closedthroat wind tunnels, with considerations of the effectof compressibility .  theoretical blockage corrections are presented for a body ofrevolution and for a three-dimensional unswept wing in acircular or rectangular wind tunnel .  the theory takes account ofthe effects of the wake and of the compressibility of the fluid,and is based on the assumption that the dimensions of the modelare small in comparison with those of the tunnel throat .formulas are given for correcting a number of the quantities, suchas dynamic pressure and mach number, measured inwind-tunnel tests .  the report presents a summary and unificationof the existing literature on the subject .
