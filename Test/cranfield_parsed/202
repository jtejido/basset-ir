aircraft flutter ..Awilliams,j..Barc r + m 2492, 1951..Waircraft flutter .  the term flutter is used here to denote maintained orviolent oscillations of a structure due to aerodynamic forcesacting in conjunction with both elastic and inertial forces .attention is restricted to this particular branch of the moregeneral field of aeroelasticity, which embraces buffeting,divergence, and reversal of control, as well as flutter,. airscrewflutter is not specifically considered .  the monograph isdivided into three main parts, each of which has been madeself-contained for the convenience of readers .  in the first part, general methods for the investigationof aircraft flutter, by theoretical analysis and by experimentson flutter models, are set out and discussed .  a detailedaccount of the aerodynamic theory of wings in non-uniformmotion is not included, since this has already been providedelsewhere, but methods for the evaluation of the aerodynamicforces required in a theoretical flutter analysis are logicallydeveloped, and a bibliography of researches on theaerodynamic theory is given in the appendix .  investigationson specific types of aircraft flutter--namely wing flutter,control surface flutter, and tab flutter--are discussed in partthese various types of flutter are considered, but the practicaldetails of flutter-prevention devices are omitted .  finally,in part 3, methods for the experimental determination ofairloads on oscillating aerofoil systems are described, andavailable airload measurements are analysed and comparedwith theoretical results .  an attempt has been made to refer in the text to all relevantbritish work reported by the early part of 1947 .  foreignwork has been mentioned in parts 1 and 2 only where necessaryfor the sake of completeness, but in part 3 and theappendix all relevant foreign references known to the author havebeen included .  matrix notation has been used for the theoretical treatment inpart 1, but otherwise its use has been avoided .
