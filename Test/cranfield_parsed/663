viscous flow along a flat plate moving at high speeds ..Akuo,y.h..Bj.ae.scs. 23, 1956, 125..Wviscous flow along a flat plate moving at high speeds .  by the distortion of coordinates, it is shown that, in the caseof supersonic viscous flow past a flat plate, the boundary-layerand simple wave theories can be combined to give a completerepresentation of the velocity and pressure fields .  consistentfirst-order solutions are considered .  an expression for theinduced pressure on the plate, correct to the second order, isobtained .  at high mach numbers the important parametersatisfies the hypersonic similarity law ,. and for arbitrary mach andreynolds numbers and for different gases, the theoretical curvecorrelates closely the experimental data .  asymptotic shockcurve and skin-friction coefficient are also deduced, but theexperimental verifications are yet to be made .
