lagrangian thermodynamics of heat transfer in systemsincluding fluid motion ..Abiot,m.a..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 568..Wlagrangian thermodynamics of heat transfer in systemsincluding fluid motion .  the lagrangian thermodynamic equations of irreversibleprocesses are extended to convective heat transfer .  thisgeneralization provides equations for the unified analysis of transientheat flow in complex systems comprising solid structures andmoving fluids in either laminar or turbulent flow .  the conceptof a surface-heat-transfer coefficient is eliminated from theformulation .  the theory is developed along two different lines .  inone approach a new concept referred to as the /trailing function/is introduced .  it represents the surface-heat-transfer propertiesand may be evaluated by quite simple but remarkably accuratevariational procedures .  the method of /associated fields/ is alsogeneralized to convective phenomena .  the second line ofapproach extends to convective heat transfer the thermodynamicconcept of entropy production for both laminar and turbulentflow .  the theory amounts to an extension of thethermodynamics of irreversible processes to systems for which onsager'srelations are not valid .
