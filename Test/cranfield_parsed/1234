direct calculation of pressure distribution on blunthypersonic nose shapes with sharp corners ..Aholt,m..Bj. ae. scs. 1961, 872..Wdirect calculation of pressure distribution on blunthypersonic nose shapes with sharp corners .  the method of belotserkovskii for calculating hypersonicflow fields past a circular cylinder is extended to deal withaxially-symmetric flow past sharp-cornered nose shapes, in particular,spherical segments and flat-headed cylinders .  results onspheres are also included .  in the present paper belotserkovskii'sfirst approximation is considered, and comparison of calculatedpressure distribution and shock shape with experimental resultsshows very good agreement .
