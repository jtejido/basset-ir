an investigation of the effect of downwash from a vtolaircraft and a helicopter in the ground environment ..Ao'bryan,t.c..Bnasa tn.d977, 1961..Wan investigation of the effect of downwash from a vtolaircraft and a helicopter in the ground environment .  dynamic-pressure measurement,in ground effect, have been obtainedabout a single-rotor helicopter anda dual-propeller vtol aircraft .  theresults indicate that the slipstreamdynamic pressure along the ground,some distance from the center ofrotation, is not a function of diskloading but merely a function ofthe gross weight or thrust of theaircraft .  furthermore, for a givengross weight the thickness of thisoutward flowing sheet of air is lessfor a small-diameter propeller (higherdisk loading propeller) .  the variation of the dynamic-pressureflow field for single anddual propellers or rotors is significantlydifferent in the plane ofsymmetry between the two rotors thanin a direction normal to thisplane .  the interaction of the twoflows produces a region of upflowin this plane where the fuselage islocated, and the decay of themaximum dynamic pressure with distanceahead of the fuselage is slower .
