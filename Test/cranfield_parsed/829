stability of thin-walled tubes under torsion ..Adonnel,l.h..Bnaca r.479, 1933, 12..Wstability of thin-walled tubes under torsion .  in this paper a theoretical solution is developed for thetorsion on a round thin-walled tube for which the wallsbecome unstable .  the results of this theory are given bya few simple formulas and curves which cover all cases .the differential equations of equilibrium are derived in asimpler form than previously found, it being shown thatmany items can be neglected .  the solution obtained islength ratio is zero and infinite, and is a goodapproximation for intermediate cases .  the theory is comparedwith all available experiments, including about 50 testsmade by the author .  the experimental-failure torque isalways smaller than the theoretical-buckling torque,averaging about 75 percent of it, with a minimum of 60percent .  as the form of the deflection checks closely withthat predicted by theory and the experiments cover a greatrange of shapes and materials, this discrepancy canreasonably be ascribed largely to initial eccentricities inactual tubes .
