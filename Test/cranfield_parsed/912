the axisymmetric free-convection temperature fieldalong a vertical thin cylinder ..Ahama,p.r., recesso,j.v. and christiaens,j..Bj. ae. scs. 1959, 335..Wthe axisymmetric free-convection temperature fieldalong a vertical thin cylinder .  with a view to studying the effect of strong transversecurvature on boundary-layer problems, the axisymmetric free-convection problem along a vertical thin cylinder is investigatedtheoretically as well as experimentally .  a theory is developedas an extension of the pohlhausen solution of a thickaxisymmetric laminar boundary layer by mark and by glauert andlighthill .  experiments consist of a thermocouple survey of thetemperature field over an electrically-heated brass cylinder ofdiameter and 10 ft. height and an interferometric studyof the density field over a bare tungsten wire of 0.02-in. diameterand 5 ft. height .  the thermal-layer thicknesses are about fiveand fifty times the radii of the cylinders, respectively .experimental results of the local heat-transfer coefficient are in excellentagreement with the theory .  this, in turn, justifies the theoriesof laminar boundary layer along a thin cylinder, at least indirectly .
