a refinement of the linearised transonic flow theory ..Ahosowaka,a..Bj.phys.soc. japan, 15, 1960..Wa refinement of the linearised transonic flow theory .  a new method is proposed to calculate the velocity and pressuredistributions around a thin symmetrical aerofoil or a slender body ofrevolution flying at transonic speed .  it is essentially a refinementof the linearized transonic flow theory due to oswatitsch and maeder,such that a correction term is introduced to take account of thenonlinear character of the transonic flow .  as examples of application,a symmetrical circular-arc aerofoil and a circular-arc body ofrevolution in the sonic flow are dealt with, and the results are foundto be in good agreement with experiments, except for the rear portion inthe latter case .
