boundary layer transition at supersonicspeeds-three-dimensional roughness effects (spheres)..Avan driest,e.r. and blumer,c.b..B.Wboundary layer transition at supersonicspeeds-three-dimensional roughness effects (spheres).  further experiments carried out in the 12-in. supersonic windtunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the californiainstitute of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensionalroughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on athe local mach number for these tests was 2.71 .  the data showclearly that the minimum (effective) size of trip required to bringtransition to its lowest reynolds number varies as the one-fourthpower of the distance from the apex of the cone to the trip .  useof available data for other mach numbers indicates that themach-number influence for effective tripping is taken intoaccount by the simple expression .some remarks concerning the roughnessvariation for transition on a blunt body are made .
