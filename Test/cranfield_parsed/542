biot's variational principle in heat conduction ..Alardner,t.j..Ba.i.a.a. j. 1963, 196..Wbiot's variational principle in heat conduction .  biot's variational principle is applied to a number of differentone-dimensional heat conduction problems .  these problemsshow the applicability of the variational principle to problemsinvolving prescribed heat flux boundary conditions and to thosewith temperature-dependent material properties .  a method is introduced for including boundary conditionswhen these are expressed as prescribed heat fluxes .  the ideabehind this is overall energy balance within the body, which is aconstraint condition to be satisfied by the time histories of thegeneralized coordinates .  the variational principle is then applied to the well-knownproblem of constant surface heat flux in order to present thetechnique and provide a basis for the remaining sections .  theequivalence of the result obtained in applying the variationalprinciple for a prescribed surface temperature history to thatobtained for a prescribed heat flux is also pointed out .  radiationcooling due to fourth power radiation from semi-infinite solidsand finite slabs together with radiation according to newton'slaw of cooling is then treated .  finally, the introduction oftemperature-dependent material properties is discussed and thedetermination of the temperature distribution in a semi-infinitesolid with variable properties is investigated .
