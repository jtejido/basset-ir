integrals and integral equations in linearized wing theory ..Alomax, h. haslet, m.a. and fuller, f.b..Bnaca rep. 1054, 1951 ..Wintegrals and integral equations in linearized wing theory .the formulas of subsonic and supersonic wing theory for source, doublet, and vortex distributions are reviewed, and a systematic presentation is provided which relates these distributions to the pressure and to thevertical induced velocity in the plane of the wing . it is shown thatcare must be used in treating the singularities involved in the analysis and that the order of integration is not always reversible . conceptssuggested by the irreversibility of order of integration are shown to be useful in the inversion of singular integral equations when operational techniques are used . a number of examples are given to illustrate themethods presented, attention being directed to supersonic flightspeeds .
