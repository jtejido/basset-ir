stagnation point heat transfer measurements in dissociatedair ..Arose,p.h. and stark,w.i..Bj. ae. scs. 26, 1958, 86..Wstagnation point heat transfer measurements in dissociatedair .  the results of an experimental investigation of the laminar heattransfer at the stagnation point of a blunt body in partiallydissociated air are presented and are compared to the theoreticaltreatment of fay and riddell .  heat-transfer results arepresented for air temperatures as high as 8,000 k. where more thanperiments were performed in a shock tube and the newexperimental techniques and principles are discussed briefly .simulation of flight stagnation conditions at velocities up to satellitevelocity of 26,000 ft. sec. is shown to be possible in shock tubes anddata has been obtained over a large altitude range at thesevelocities .
