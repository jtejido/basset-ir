the effect of an internal compressible fluid columnon the breathing vibrations of a thin pressurised cylindricalshell ..Aberry,j.g. and reissner,e..Bj. ae. scs. 25, 1958,288..Wthe effect of an internal compressible fluid columnon the breathing vibrations of a thin pressurised cylindricalshell .  the free oscillations of a thin pressurized cylindrical shellcontaining a compressible fluid are studied here .  the use of anapproximate set of shell equations (shallow shell theory) leads toa relatively simple formula for the natural frequencies of thecoupled fluid-cylinder system .  the results of somecomputations are presented .
