on the solution of the laminar boundary layer equations ..Atani,i..Bj.phys.soc.japan, 4, 1949, 149..Won the solution of the laminar boundary layer equations .  the theory of the laminar boundary layeroffers a means of determining the skin frictionunder the assumption of a given velocitydistribution outside the boundary layer .  owing to themathematical difficulties, however, exact solutionsare possible only when the velocity distributionis expressed as a simple function of the distancealong the surface .  more complicated velocitydistributions necessitate recourse to the method ofexpansion in series or that of step-by-stepcalculations, but the labor involved is too great for themethods to be of practical use .  approximatemethod due to pohlhausen (1921), which had longbeen recommended for general use, gives areasonably accurate solution in a region of acceleratedflow, but recently its adequacy in a region ofretarded flow has been questioned .  separation offlow may actually occur where the solution ofpohlhausen fails to give it .  more recently howarthsolution, which gives fairly reasonable results ina region of retarded flow .  howarth's solution essentially consists insolving the boundary layer equations for the particularcase in which the velocity u outside the boundarylayer decreases linearly with the distance xmeasured along the surface, and utilizing the solutionby replacing the actual distribution of u by acircumscribing polygon of infinitesimal sides .therefore, it is assumed that the velocitydistribution at any section depends on the velocitygradient du/dx at that section only, being affectedby the conditions upstream only in so far as thisaffects the momentum thickness 0 .  in other words,the velocity distribution across the boundary layeris determined by a parameter .
