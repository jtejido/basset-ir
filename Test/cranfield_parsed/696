pressure loads produced on a flat-plate wing by rocket jets exhaustingin a spanwise direction below the wing and perpendicular to afree-stream flow of mach number 2.0 ..Afalangan, r.a. and janos, j. j..Bnasa tn d-893, 1961 ..Wpressure loads produced on a flat-plate wing by rocket jets exhaustingin a spanwise direction below the wing and perpendicular to afree-stream flow of mach number 2.0 .an investigation at a reynolds number per foot of 14.4 x 10 was made todetermine the pressure loads produced on a flat-plate wing by rocketjets exhausting in a spanwise direction beneath the wing andperpendicular to a free-stream flow of mach number 2.0 . the ranges of thevariables involved were /1/ nozzle types - one sonic /jet mach number oftwo-dimensional supersonic /jet mach number of 1.71/,. /2/ verticalnozzle positions beneath the wing of 4, 8, and 12 nozzle-throatdiameters,. and /3/ ratios of rocket-chamber total pressure tofree-stream static pressure from 0 to 130 .the incremental normal force due to jet interference on the wing variedfrom one to two times the rocket thrust and generally decreased as thepressure ratio increased . the chordwise coordinate of theincremental-normal-force center of pressure remained upstream of the nozzle centerline for the nozzle positions and pressure ratios of the investigation . the chordwise coordinate approached zero as the jet vertical distancebeneath the wing increased . in the spanwise direction there was littlechange due to varying rocket-jet position and pressure ratio . someboundary-layer flow separation on the wing was observed for the rocketjets close to the wing and at the higher pressure ratios . the magnitude of the chordwise and spanwise pressure distributions due to jetinterference was greatest for rocket jets close to the wing and decreased asthe jet was displaced farther from the wing .the design procedure for the rockets used is given in the appendix .
