formulas for the supersonic loading, lift and dragof flat swept back wings with leading edges behindthe mach lines ..Acohen,d..Bnaca r.1050, 1951..Wformulas for the supersonic loading, lift and dragof flat swept back wings with leading edges behindthe mach lines .  the method of superposition of linearized conical flows hasbeen applied to the calculation of the aerodynamic properties, insupersonic flight, of thin flat, swept-back wings at an angle ofattack .  the wings are assumed to have rectilinear plan forms,with tips parallel to the stream, and to taper in the conventionalsense .  the investigation covers the moderately supersonic speedrange where the mach lines from the leading-edge apex lie aheadof the wing .  the trailing edge may lie ahead of or behind themach lines from its apex .  the case in which the mach conefrom one tip intersects the other tip is not treated .  formulas are obtained for the load distribution, the total lift,and the drag due to lift .  for the cases in which the trailing edgeis outside the mach cone from its apex (supersonic trailing edge),the formulas are complete .  for the wing with both leading andtrailing edges behind their respective mach lines, a degree ofapproximation is necessary .  it has been found possible to givepractical formulas which permit the total lift and drag to becalculated to within 2 or 3 percent of the accuratelinearized-theory value .  the local lift can be determined accurately overmost of the wing, but the trailing-edge-tip region is treated onlyapproximately .  charts of some of the functions derived are included tofacilitate computing, and several examples are worked out in outline .
