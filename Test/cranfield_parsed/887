buckling due to thermal stress of cylindrical shellssubjected to axial temperature distributions ..Ajohns,d.j..Bcoa r.147, 1961..Wbuckling due to thermal stress of cylindrical shellssubjected to axial temperature distributions .  thermal stress distributions in uniform circular cylindrical shellsdue to axial temperature distributions are investigated .  thediscontinuity effect due to the presence of a cooler stiffening bulkhead isconsidered, and the possibility of thermal buckling of the shell due tothe circumferential discontinuity stress is examined .  the bucklinganalysis is based on donnell's shell equation, and particular attentionis given to shells having clamped edges .  an experimental investigation of this buckling problem is discussed,and the results obtained are seen to agree reasonably well with theory .
