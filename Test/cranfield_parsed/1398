stability of rectangular plates under shear and bendingforces ..Away,s..Bj. app. mech. 3, 1936, a131..Wstability of rectangular plates under shear and bendingforces .  the author first discusses the problem of a plane, simplysupported rectangular plate loaded by shearing forces inthe plane of the plate on all four edges .  there are twostiffeners attached one third and two thirds of the wayalong the plate .  the critical load is calculated for variousstiffener rigidities .  also, the rigidity necessary to keepthe stiffeners straight when the plate buckles is found .this stiffener rigidity is found to be slightly larger thanthat necessary for a plate with one stiffener and the samepanel dimensions as the plate with two stiffeners .  the second problem discussed by the author is that of aplane, simply supported rectangular plate loaded byuniformly distributed edge shearing forces in the plane of theplate and linearly distributed tension and compression inthe plane of the plate at the ends .  the end forces varyfrom tension, at one corner to, at the other corner,so that their resultant is a bending moment .  thepresence of the edge shearing forces is found to diminish thecritical bending stress in this case .  calculations are madefor various magnitudes of bending and shearing forces forplates of various proportions .
