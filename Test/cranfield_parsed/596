the properties of crossed flexure pivots, and the influence of thepoint at which the strips cross ..Awittrick, w.h..Baero. quart. v. 2, 1950-1 ..Wthe properties of crossed flexure pivots, and the influence of thepoint at which the strips cross .it is shown that the rotational stiffness of a crossed flexure pivotvaries considerably when subjected to an applied force . the type ofvariation can be radically changed simply by moving the point at whichthe strips cross . the relation between torque and rotation for a givenapplied force is not exactly linear and the extent of the non-linearityis determined by taking into account the small movements of the centreof rotation of the pivot . finally, for design purposes, an analysis ofthe maximum stresses in the strips is given .
