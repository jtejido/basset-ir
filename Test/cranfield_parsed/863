loads and deformations of buckled rectangular plates ..Astein,m..Bnasa tr r40, 1959..Wloads and deformations of buckled rectangular plates .  the nonlinear large deflection equations of von karman for platesare converted into a set of linear equations by expanding thedisplacements into a power series in terms of an arbitrary parameter .  thepost-buckling behavior of simply supported rectangular plates subjectedto longitudinal compression and to a uniform temperature rise isinvestigated in detail by solving the first few of the equations .  experimental data are presented for the compression problem .comparisons are made for total shortening and local strains and deflectionswhich indicate good agreement between experimental and theoreticalresults .
