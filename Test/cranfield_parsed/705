on the kernel function of the integral equation relating the lift anddownwash distributions of oscillating finite wings in subsonic flow ..Awatkins, c.e. and runyal, h.l. and woolston, d.s..Bnaca rep. 1234, 1955 ..Won the kernel function of the integral equation relating the lift anddownwash distributions of oscillating finite wings in subsonic flow .this report treats the kernel function of an integral equation thatrelates a known or prescribed downwash distribution to an unknown liftdistribution for a harmonically oscillating finite wing in compressiblesubsonic flow . the kernel function is reduced to a form that can beaccurately evaluated by separating the kernel function into two parts .. a part in which the singularities are isolated and analyticallyexpressed and a nonsingular part which may be tabulated . the form of thekernel function for the sonic case /mach number of 1/ is treatedseparately . in addition, results for the special cases of mach numberof o /incompressible case/ and frequency of o /steady case/ are given .the derivation of the integral equation which involves this kernelfunction, originally performed elsewhere /see, for example, nacatechnical memorandum 979/, is reproduced as an appendix . another appendixgives the reduction of the form of the kernel function obtained hereinfor the three-dimensional case to a known result of possio fortwo-dimensional flow . a third appendix contains some remarks on theevaluation of the kernel function, and a fourth appendix presents analternate form of expression for the kernel function .
