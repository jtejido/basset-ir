the motion of a viscous liquid past a paraboloid ..Amather,d.j..Bq.j.mech.app.math. 14, 1961, 423..Wthe motion of a viscous liquid past a paraboloid .  an approximate solution for the steadyflow of incompressible viscous liquid pasta paraboloid of revolution is described .an assumption is made for the form of thestokes stream function and substitutedinto the navier-stokes equations usingparaboloidal coordinates .  after makingsuitable approximations, a non-lineardifferential equation for a function f isdeduced .  the solutions of this equationdepend on the reynolds number of theflow considered .  examples found bynumerical integration are given to illustratethe properties of the function f forreynolds numbers varying from 0.0001 tois found, and it is shown that this approximatesolution tends to the perfect fluidflow away from the boundary, allowancebeing made for the displacement effect ofwhat may be called the boundary layer .
