study of creep collapse of a long circular cylindricalshell under various distributed force systems ..Aserpico,j.c..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 1316..Wstudy of creep collapse of a long circular cylindricalshell under various distributed force systems .  an analysis is presented for determining the collapse of circularrings and long cylinders subjected to primary and secondary creepconditions at elevated temperatures .  the types of loadingconsidered for the present investigation are dead loading andhydrostatic pressure-type forces .  the method of solution is based onan application of the variational theorem for creep described inref. 1 with some additional terms being introduced for thepressure-type loading case .  the general results are reduced to arelatively simple form for the theoretical predictions of collapsetime and are graphically illustrated for a typical sample material .
