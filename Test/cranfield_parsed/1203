the propagation of a nonuniform magnetohydrodynamicshock wave into a moving monatomic fluid ..Agundersen,r.m..Bj. ae. scs. 1962, 1421..Wthe propagation of a nonuniform magnetohydrodynamicshock wave into a moving monatomic fluid .  an initially uniform magnetohydrodynamic shock wave ofarbitrary strength propagates through a channel which consists oftwo portions of which one has uniform cross-sectional area whilethe other is of varying cross-sectional area .  it is assumed thatthe flow in the nonuniform section in front of the shock is initiallya uniform state and no perturbations (due to the area variations)of this flow reach the shock until the area variation is encountered .when the shock enters the nonuniform section, it is perturbed,the shock strength altered and the subsequent flow isnonisentropic .  in addition to the perturbation due to the effect of thearea variations on the initially uniform upstream flow, there aretwo further contributions--viz., a permanent perturbationcaused directly by the area changes and a transientdisturbance--which propagates with true sonic speed with respect to the flowbehind the shock, due to reflections of the permanentperturbation at the shock .  expressions for these various contributions areobtained .  the results presented include as special casespropagation of a nonuniform conventional gas dynamic shock into amoving nonconduction fluid and propagation of a nonuniformhydromagnetic shock wave into a stationary fluid .
