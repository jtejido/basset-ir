method for calculation of compressible laminar boundarylayer characteristics in axial pressure gradient withzero heat transfer ..Amorduchow,m. and clarke,j.h..Bnaca tn.2784, 1952..Wmethod for calculation of compressible laminar boundarylayer characteristics in axial pressure gradient withzero heat transfer .  the karman-pohlhausen method is extended primarily to sixth-degreevelocity profiles for determiningthe characteristics of the compressiblelaminar boundary layer over an adiabaticwall in the presence of an axialpressure gradient .  it is assumed that the prandtl number is unity andthat the coefficient of viscosity varies linearly with the temperature .a general approximate solution which permits a rapid determination ofthe boundary-layer characteristics for any given free-stream mach numberand given velocity distribution at the outer edge of the boundary layeris obtained .  numerical examples indicate that this solution will inpractice lead to results of satisfactoryaccuracy, including the criticalreynolds number for stability .  for the special purpose of calculatingthe location of the separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, ashort and simple method, based on the use of a seventh-degree velocityprofile, is derived .  the numerical example given here indicates thatthis method should in practice lead to sufficiently accurate results .for the special case of flow near a forward stagnation point it is shownthat the karman-pohlhausen method with the usual fourth-degree profilesleads to results of adequate accuracy, even for the critical reynoldsnumber .
