freeman method ..A.B.Wfreeman method .the freeman method (ref. 26) is similar tochester's method in that the newtonian-plus-centrifugal solution (eq.with the von mises transformation .  a method of successiveapproximations is applied to both plane and axially symmetric blunt-nosed bodiesfor small and infinite free-stream mach number .formulas for the streamlines, shock shape, and pressure distribution aredetermined to this approximation .  a number of special shapes aretreated in ref. 26, and in certain cases the theory has a singular pointwhere the first approximation to the pressure vanishes., that is,for a sphere (see eq. 7-113) .  as in chester's method, the theory isnot applicable where the pressure becomes too small .
