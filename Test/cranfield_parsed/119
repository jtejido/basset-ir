conduction of fluctuating heat flow in a wall consistingof many layers ..Avodicka,v..Bapp.sc.res. 5, 1955, 108..Wconduction of fluctuating heat flow in a wall consistingof many layers .  van gorcum has pointed to interesting and important analogiesbetween the theory of a passive four-pole and the conduction of heatwaves through stratiform bodies .  this paper generalizes in certainregards van gorcum's ideas and draws their consequences for the case ofa solid, bounded by two infinite parallel planes and consisting of anynumber of layers made from different materials .
