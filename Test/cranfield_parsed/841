on the bending of circular cylindrical shells underpure bending ..Aseide,p. and weingarten,v.i..Bj. app. mech. 28, 1961..Won the bending of circular cylindrical shells underpure bending .the stability of circular cylindrical shells under pure bending isinvestigated by means of batdorf's modified donnell's equation and thegalerkin method .  the results of this investigation have shown that,contrary to the commonly accepted value, the maximum critical bendingstress is for all practical purposes equal to the critical compressivestress .
