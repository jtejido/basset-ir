second-order effects in laminar boundary layers ..Amaslen,s.h..Ba.i.a.a. j. 1963, 33..Wsecond-order effects in laminar boundary layers .  second-order boundary layer disturbances aredue to the displacement of the main flow bythe boundary layer, surface curvature, freestreamvorticity, and slip .  a procedure for findingthese is given for compressible flow of a perfect gashaving a classically similar boundary layer .solutions are given for the flat plate and circularcylinder and for the hypersonic axisymmetricstagnation point .  for the latter flow, the dominanteffect is that of vorticity, which increasesboth shear and heat flux .  for the plate or cylinder,the same conclusion tends to hold for highspeed flow .  the vorticity effect is governed by theentire outer flow--not just the wall vorticity .
