similar temperature boundary layers ..Adragutin stojanovic.Buniversity of beograd, jugoslavia.Wsimilar temperature boundary layers .conditions for the existence of similar solutions are known for (a)two-dimensional, incompressible, steady and nonsteady laminar boundarylayers and (b) three-dimensional, incompressible, steady, laminarboundary layers for a body of revolution rotating in a fluid at rest ora body of revolution in a rotating fluid flow .  correspondingconditions for the existence of similar temperature boundary layers inboth cases are given for constant and variable wall temperatures .  thegeneral conclusion is that, in all these cases, with or without viscousheating, and with constant wall temperature, conditions for theexistence of similar velocity boundary layers are at the same time theconditions for the existence of similar temperature boundary layers .if the wall temperature is variable, the conditions for the existenceof similar velocity boundary layers are at the same time theconditions for the existence of similar temperature boundary layers if thewall temperature varies as a power of the local free-stream velocityor surface velocity .  numberical solutions are given for thenondimensional temprature distributions function and the nondimensionaltemperature gradient at the wall for several prandtl numbers in the caseof a rotating flow over an infinite plate at rest .
