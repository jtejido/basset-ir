bodt freedom flutter of ground launched rocket modelsat supersonic and high subsonic speeds ..Agaukroger,d.r..Brae r. struct.237, 1957..Wbodt freedom flutter of ground launched rocket modelsat supersonic and high subsonic speeds .  a theoretical investigation of symmetricbody freedom flutter of a rocket model is described .  the resultsconfirm that structural failures of models were causedby this type of flutter, and an extension of the investigationindicates the parameters that are of importance .  a highratio of body to wing mass and a well forward position of theoverall centre of gravity are conditions under which fluttermay occur .  increase of body pitching radius of gyrationand tailplane volume are beneficial .  it is concluded that this type of flutter may be significantin some aircraft designs, and that the canard has noadvantage in this respect over the conventional lay-out of wingand tailplane .
