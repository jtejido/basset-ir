transtability flutter of supersonic aircraft panels ..Ar. p. isaacs.Brand corp..Wtranstability flutter of supersonic aircraft panels .for certain aero-elastic configurations it is possible to ascertaincritical flutter conditions from static considerations alone .  theidea is simply one of negation..  when the air speed exceeds a certainvalue statically stable equilibrium - and sometimes equilibrium itselftake place .  there are times when the dynamics of a situation arecomplex enough to defy a tractable analysis .  the value of being ableto indicate a flutter criterion from the simpler statics is clear .we will suppose flutter begins when some critical value of the airspeed (or some parameter simply related the to) is exceeded .  herewe will show that there is a critical value which, when exceeded,precludes static equilibrium .  underlying our work is the premisethat these two critical values are the same .  this assumption begsdiscussion .we will call the lowest value of our air speed parameter to precludestatically stable equilibrium of the system the transtability value .in some cases, excess of this value will ban all possibility ofstatic equilibrium - stable or not., we will then call it a strongtranstability value .
