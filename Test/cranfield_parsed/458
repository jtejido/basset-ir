a new series for calculation of steady laminar boundarylayer flows ..Agortler,h..Bj. math. mech. 6, 1957, 1..Wa new series for calculation of steady laminar boundarylayer flows .  a new and general method for solvingproblems of plane and steady laminarboundary layer flows in incompressiblefluids with arbitrary outer pressuredistribution is developed .  this methodis based on the introduction of thedimensionless quantitiesas new independent spatial variables .ordinates, u(x) the given outer velocitydistribution, v the kinematic viscosity .)the solution of the boundary layer problemis then given as a power series in ewith coefficient functions depending on n .this series is a formally exact solutionof the boundary layer problem .  the new series solution has the following qualities ..      have the significance only of cartesian      coordinates, the influence of wall      curvature being neglected in boundary      layer theory, the new coordinates      are adjusted to the data of the special      problem in any case of application .      the new variables represent a logical      development of former efforts in      the field of boundary-layer flow calculation .      with other series solutions known for      some special cases is that the leading      term of the new series satisfies      exactly the outer boundary condition      at all cross-sections along the wall .      therefore, the succeeding terms give      corrections only in the inner part of      the boundary layer .  accordingly,      taking also no. 1 into account, the zero      order term by itself gives a good      approximation for the boundary layer flow .
