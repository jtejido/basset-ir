advantages and limitations of models ..Asobey,a.j..Bj. r. ae. s. 63, 1959, 646..Wadvantages and limitations of models .summary ..  the use of models for structural test investigations in thepresence of kinetic heating effects is examined .  the principalfeatures of the complex process to berepresented are discussed under the classificationsexternal air flow, internal heat transfer,elastic response .  of these the second is foundto influence most model design, and ananalysis of a typical structure is included toillustrate the various contributions tointernal heat transfer .
