the surface oil flow technique as used in high speedwind tunnels in the united kingdom ..Astanbrook,a..Brae tn.aero.2712, 1960..Wthe surface oil flow technique as used in high speedwind tunnels in the united kingdom .  an examination has been made of thevarious versions of the surface oilflow technique used in different high speedwind tunnels .  to providebackground information for this investigationsome systematic tests were made ona simple model in a small supersonic tunnel .the experience gained made itpossible to explain many of the variationsin terms of the different operatingconditions of the tunnels .  the time taken to form a patternon a typical model is, to a firstapproximation, directly proportional tothe value of the parameter,the factor being 36,000 12,000 .  thetime taken appears to be independentof the initial thickness of the oil sheet .  a general procedure for the developmentof oil mixtures for any purposeis suggested .
