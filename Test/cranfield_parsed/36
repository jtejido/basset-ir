supersonic flow around blunt bodies ..Aserbin,h..Bj. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 58..Wsupersonic flow around blunt bodies .the newtonian theory of impact has been shown to beuseful for pressure calculations on the forward facing partof bodies moving at high speed .  it is now a familiar practiceto use this information to calculate nonviscous velocities at thewall and then to estimate rates of heat transfer .  thisprocedure is perhaps open to question,. heat-transfer rates dependon velocity gradients which are not given by the newtoniananalysis .  nor can one obtain information on boundary-layerstability or all the body stability derivatives .  it seems,therefore, inevitable that, as design proceeds with these hypersonicmissiles, there will be a greater need for more accurateaerodynamic theories either to predict what will happen in unfamiliarflight conditions or to effect an extrapolation from a known testresult to the design condition .
