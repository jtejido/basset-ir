the supersonic flow about a blunt body of revolutionfor gases at chemical equilibrium ..Agravalos,f.g., edelflet,i.h. and emmons,h..B9th int. astro. fed. 1958..Wthe supersonic flow about a blunt body of revolutionfor gases at chemical equilibrium .  the supersonic flow about a blunt body ofrevolution for gases at chemicalequilibrium .  a method to determine the shockwave, and its location, about a bodyof revolution moving at supersonic speeds is given .the method provides also the meansto compute the flow characteristics in the shock layer .the fluid in which the motiontakes place is assumed to be in chemical equilibriumwithin the shock layer ,. itsthermochemical properties must be known .  the essentialnew features of the method are ..a) it solves the direct problem, i. e., the initial dataare the conditions upstream andthe body shape ,. b) the integration of the fundamentalequations is done in the physicalplane and the difficulties inherent to other, less direct,mathematical formulationsof the problem are avoided .  a physical interpretation ofthe method is made whichis in accord with the analytical definition of the problem .
