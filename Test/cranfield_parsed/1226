heat transfer in the laminar boundary layer with ablationof vapor of arbitrary molecular weight ..Afaulders,c.r..Bj. ae. scs. 1962, 76..Wheat transfer in the laminar boundary layer with ablationof vapor of arbitrary molecular weight .  the reduction of heat transfer in the laminar boundary layerunder the condition of vaporizing ablation is analyzed forarbitrary molecular weight of the vapor .  primary assumptions arethat the pressure gradient is zero, the individual components ofthe binary system are perfect gases, the prandtl number isconstant, and the viscosity is proportional to temperature .variations through the boundary layer of the schmidt number forbinary diffusion and the density-viscosity product, areincluded in the analysis .  the wall temperature is held constant .numerical results are obtained for prandtl numbers of 0.75 andvarying from 0.25 to 4.00, wall concentration of the foreign gasas high as 0.9 (corresponding to the high heat rates encounteredduring re-entry), and ratio of specific heats of foreign gas equalto that of air .  kinetic theory is used to obtain schmidt numberas a function of molecular weight and concentration .  the departure of schmidt number and prandtl number fromunity and the variation of reynolds analogy factor with prandtlnumber, blowing parameter, wall concentration, and molecularweight ratio are found to have relatively minor influence on theheat block ratio at high rates of ablation .  the primary factorgoverning the influence of molecular weight ratio on the heatblock ratio is the variation of across the boundary layer .little loss of accuracy is incurred, in the range of molecular weightratios considered here, by assuming schmidt and prandtlnumbers of unity as long as the variation is properly taken into account .
