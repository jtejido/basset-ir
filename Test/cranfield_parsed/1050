compressive buckling of simply supported curved platesand cylinders of sandwich construction ..Astein,m. and mayers,j..Bnaca tn.2601, 1952..Wcompressive buckling of simply supported curved platesand cylinders of sandwich construction .  theoretical solutions are presentedfor the buckling in uniformaxial compression of two types of simplysupported curved sandwichplates ..  the corrugated-core type and theisotropic-core type .  thesolutions are obtained from a theory fororthotropic curved plates inwhich deflections due to shear are takeninto account .  results aregiven in the form of equations and curves .
