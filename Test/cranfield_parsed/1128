face wrinkling and core strength in sandwich construction ..Ayuseff,s..Bj. ae. scs. 1960..Wface wrinkling and core strength in sandwich construction .  the effect of initial waviness on the wrinkling offaces in sandwich construction is studied .  formulae arederived to determine the failing stress when the faceswrinkle due to failure of the core in tension, compressionor shear .  the importance of core strength requirementsin maintaining surface smoothness is noted .  acomparison of theory with experiments is made, and theagreement between the two is found to be reasonably good .the strength of the core .  williams has related the strengthof the core in tension and shear to an arbitrarily assumedinitial irregularity which, to ensure laminar flow in a wingis assumed to have a maximum admissible value (initialwave amplitude critical wavelength=0.0005 to 0.001) .
