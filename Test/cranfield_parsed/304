first-order approach to a strong interaction problemin hypersonic flow over an insulated flat plate ..Aoguchi,h..Buniv. tokyo aero.res r330, 1958..Wfirst-order approach to a strong interaction problemin hypersonic flow over an insulated flat plate .  the present paper concerns withthe strong interaction phenomenon over aninsulated semi-infinite flat plate with a sharpleading edge .  in particular the main interestis in the consistent treatment in which theboundary-layer solution may be joinedcontinuously with the inviscid solution regardingflow variables including pressure, normalvelocity, temperature (or streamwise velocity) and density .  it is shown that the behavior of the inviscidsolution may be consistent with that of theboundary-layer solution to at least first-orderapproximation that is correct to the order of,where m is the machnumber of undisturbed flow, r the reynoldsnumber based on the distance from leadingedge and the ratio of specific heats .  thenthe first-order boundary-layer problem isformulated under such an external circumstanceand an attempt is made for arriving at the solution .  actual calculations are carried out for bothcases of air and helium .  from the solutionit is found that the region in which the viscouseffect plays a significant role is ranged overfrom 0 to a certain finite value of n, say n, interms of the similarity coordinate n in thecorresponding incompressible boundary layer .the numerical results moreover indicatethat the induced pressure is considerably smallerthan the estimate of lees (7) obtained byhis approximate method in which the effectof the first-order induced pressure on theboundary layer is ignored and no survey of thefirst-order boundary-layer equation is made .the present results are also found to be inexcellent agreement with experimental datarecently obtained in helium flow by erickson (15) .
