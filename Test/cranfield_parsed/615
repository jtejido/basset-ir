the contraction of satellite orbits under the influence of air drag .part iii . high eccentricity orbits . /0.2 e 1/ ..Aking-hele, d.g..Br.a.e. tn. space 1, 1962 ..Wthe contraction of satellite orbits under the influence of air drag .part iii . high eccentricity orbits . /0.2 e 1/ .the effect of air drag on satellite orbits of eccentricity e less thanbetween 0.2 and 1 is presented . equations are derived which show howperigee distance and orbital period vary with eccentricity during thesatellite's life, and how eccentricity is related to time,.and formulaeare obtained for the lifetime and the air density at perigee, in termsof the rate of change of period . the results are also presentedgraphically and their implications and limitations are discussed .
