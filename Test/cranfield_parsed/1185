an integral method for calculating heat and mass transferin laminar boundary layers ..Aculick,f.e.c..Baiaa jnl. 1963, 783..Wan integral method for calculating heat and mass transferin laminar boundary layers .  an integral method previously used successfullyin several kinds of boundary layer problemshas been extended to treat simultaneous heat andmass transfer in a binary-mixture laminarboundary layer when the pressure is uniform .the principal results are two pairs of dualintegral relations arising from solutions to theintegral concentration and energy equations .one pair connects the surface mass transfer rateand surface concentration of injected gas,. theother relates surface temperature and heat transferrate in the presence of mass transfer .only the cases of helium and air injection into anundissociated air stream are discussed indetail, but the method can be applied to problemsinvolving other gases .  the approximateresults agree quite well with some numerical solutionsand with recent experimental resultsfor which no numerical solutions are available .
