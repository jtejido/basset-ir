the viscous flow near a stagnation point when the external flow hasuniform vorticity ..Aj. t. stuart.Bnational physical laboratory, teddington, middlesex, england.Wthe viscous flow near a stagnation point when the external flow hasuniform vorticity .in view of the recent controversy between li and glauert on the natureof the solution of the boundary-layer equations when the externalflow is rotational, it seems worthwhile to draw attention to a certainexact solution of the navier-stokes equations which lends support toglauert's point of view .
