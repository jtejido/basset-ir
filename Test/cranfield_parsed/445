on the application of mathieu functions in the theoryof subsonic compressible flow past oscillating airfoils ..Areissner,e..Bnaca tn.1961..Won the application of mathieu functions in the theoryof subsonic compressible flow past oscillating airfoils .  an account is given of explicit solutions in terms of mathieu functionfunctions of the problem of two-dimensional subsonic compressibleflow past oscillating airfoils .  the results are applied to thecalculation of three-dimensional corrections for the two-dimensionaltheory and the effect of the incorporation of the three-dimensionaleffects on the mathieu function solution of the two-dimensionalproblem is shown .  the developments are formal and must besupplemented by an appreciable amount of numerical calculations before thetheory can be applied to specific problems .
