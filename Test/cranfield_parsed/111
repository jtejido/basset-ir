the laminar boundary layer equation: a method of solutionby means of an automatic computer ..Aleigh,d.c.f..Bproc. cam. phil. s. 51, 1955, 320..Wthe laminar boundary layer equation: a method of solutionby means of an automatic computer .  a method, very suitable for use with an automatic computer,of solving the hartree-womersley approximation to theincompressible boundary-layer equation is developed .it is based on an iterative process and the choleski methodof solving a simultaneous set of linear algebraic equations .the programming of this method for an automatic computer isdiscussed .  tables of a solution of the boundary-layerequation in a region upstream of the separation point aregiven .  in the upstream neighbourhood of separationthis solution is compared with goldstein'sasymptotic solution andthe agreement is good .
