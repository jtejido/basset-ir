regularities in creep and hot fatigue data ..Agraham,a. and walles,k.f.a..Barc cp.379, 1958..Wregularities in creep and hot fatigue data .  published experimental results are assembled to support apreviously-given theory of uniaxial deformation, and the theory is then used toanalyse published data on the creep-rupture and hot-fatigue ofengineering materials .  the theory enables data for different times andtemperatures to be classed together, thereby providing information overa much greater range of times than could practicably be covered byexperiments at a single temperature .  an underlying numerical patterncommon to all the widely different group 8 materials considered thenshows through the experimental scatter .  data for further engineeringmaterials is considered in these terms in part 2 .
