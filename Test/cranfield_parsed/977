concerning some solutions of the boundary layer equationsin hydrodynamics ..Agoldstein,s..Bproc. cam. phil. soc. 26, 1930, 18..Wconcerning some solutions of the boundary layer equationsin hydrodynamics .  the boundary-layer equations fora steady two-dimensional motionare solved for any given initialvelocity distribution (distribution along anormal to the boundary wall,downstream of which the motion is to becalculated) .  this initial velocitydistribution is assumed expressibleas a polynomial in the distance fromthe wall .  three cases are considered ..first, when in the initial distributionthe velocity vanishes at the wall,but its gradient along the normaldoes not,. second, when the velocity inthe initial distribution does notvanish at the wall,. and third, when boththe velocity and its normal gradientvanish at the wall (as at a pointwhere the forward flow separatesfrom the boundary) .  the solution isfound as a power series in somefractional power of the distance alongthe wall, whose coefficients arefunctions of the distance from the wall tobe found from ordinary differentialequations .  some progress is madein the numerical calculation ofthese coefficients, especially in the firstcase .  the main object was tofind means for a step-by-step calculationof the velocity field in a boundarylayer, and it is thought that such aprocedure may possibly be successfuleven if laborious .  the samemathematical method is used to calculatethe flow behind a flat plate along astream .  the results are shown incurves in the original .
