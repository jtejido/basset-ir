a study of inviscid flow about air foils at high supersonicspeeds ..Aeggers, a.j., syvertson, c.a., and krqus, s..Bnaca report 1123.Wa study of inviscid flow about air foils at high supersonicspeeds .steady flow about curved airfoils at high supersonic speeds isinvestigated analyticially . with the assumption that air behavesas a diatomic gas, it is found the the shock-expansionmethod may be used to predict the flow about curved airfoils up toextremely high mach numbers, provided the flow deflectionangles are not too close to those corresponding to shockdetachment . this result applies not only to the determination of thesurface pressure distribution, but also to the determination of thewhole flow field about an airfoil . verification of this observationis obtained with the aid of the method of characteristics byextensive calculations of the pressure gradient and shock-wavecurvature at the leading edge, and by calculations of the pressuredistribution on a 10-percent-thick biconvex airfoil at 0 angle ofattack .an approximation to the shock-expansion method for thinairfoils at high mach numbers is also investigated and is foundto yield pressures in error by less than 10 percent at machnumbers above three and flow deflection angles up to 25 . thisslender-airfoil method is relatively simple in form and thus mayprove useful for some engineering purposes .effects of caloric imperfections of air manifest in disturbedflow fields at  high mach numbers are investigated, particularattention being given to the reduction of the ratio of specificheats . so long as this ratio does not decrease appreciably belowto include the effects of these imperfections, should be substantiallyas accurate as for ideal-gas flows . this observation isverfied with the aid of a generalized shock-expansion method and ageneralized method of characteristics employed in forms applicablefor local air temperatures up to about 5000 rankine .the slender-airfoil method is modified to employ an averagevalue of the ratio of specific heats for a particular flow field .this simplified method has essentially the same accuracy forimperfect-gas flows as its counterpart has for ideal-gas flows .an approximate flow analysis is made at extremely high machnumbers where it is indicated that the ratio of specific heats mayapproach close to 1 . in this case, it is found that theshock-expansion method may be in considerable error,. however, thebusemann method for the limit of infinite free-stream machnumber and specific-heat ratio of 1 appears to apply withreasonable accuracy .
