tables of complete elliptic integrals ..Aheuman,c..Bj. maths. and phys. v. 20, 1941, pp 127-206 ..Wtables of complete elliptic integrals .the present paper contains a set of tables of complete ellipticintegrals computed and collected especially for applications to certaindynamical problems .the tabulated functions are four in number and are denoted byf/a/, g/a/, e/a/, and/a,b/respectively . the definitions of thesefunctions and their connections with the functions of legendre will bediscussed in the following .
