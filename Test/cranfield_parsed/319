propagation of weak disturbances in a gas subject torelaxation effects ..Amoore,f.k. and gibson,w.e..Bj. ae. scs. 27, 1960..Wpropagation of weak disturbances in a gas subject torelaxation effects .  a generalized wave equation is derived for sound disturbancesin a gas when relaxation effects connected with, for example,molecular vibration or dissociation are important .  solutionsinvolving discontinuous wave fronts are presented, and it is shownthat, under certain assumptions, the complete wave equationreduces to a variant of the telegraph equation .  detailed solutionsare presented for disturbance fields produced by a wavy wall insubsonic and supersonic flow and a simple wedge in supersonicflow .  this study is viewed as a step in the development of atheory of small disturbances of a high-temperature gas, as is foundbehind the shock in hypersonic flight .
