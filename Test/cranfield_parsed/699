approximate indical lift functions for several wings of finite span inincompressible flow as obtained from oscillatory lift coefficients ..Adrischler j.a..Bnaca tn 3639, 1956 ..Wapproximate indical lift functions for several wings of finite span inincompressible flow as obtained from oscillatory lift coefficients .the unsteady-lift functions for a wing undergoing a sudden change insinking speed have been presented for delta wings having aspect ratiosof 0, 2, and 4 and for rectangular and elliptical wings having aspectratios of 0, 3, and 6 . for the elliptical and rectangular wings thespanwise lift distributions were also presented . these functions werecalculated from the lift coefficients associated with a wing oscillating harmonically in pure translational motion, as obtained from severalsources .the results of these calculations indicate that the normalizedunsteady-lift functions are substantially independent of the shape ofthe plan form for elliptical, rectangular, or moderately tapered wings,. however, for delta wings the increase of lift toward the steady-statevalue is much more rapid than that for the aforementioned wings of thesame aspect ratio . these results also corroborate the results of otherinvestigations in that the rate of growth of lift tends to increase with a decrease in aspect ratio . the shape of the spanwise distributions of the indicial lift seems to be, for all practical purposes, independentof time for rectangular and elliptical wings .
