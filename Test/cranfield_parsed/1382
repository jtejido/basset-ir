the solution of the equations of the laminar boundarylayer for schubauer's observed pressure distributionfor an elliptic cylinder ..Ahartree,d.r..Barc r + m.2427, 1949..Wthe solution of the equations of the laminar boundarylayer for schubauer's observed pressure distributionfor an elliptic cylinder .  the solution of the equations of the laminarboundary layer has been carried out for the pressuredistribution for an elliptic cylinder of axial ratio 2.96 ..  1 withits major axis in the direction of the incident stream .the solution has been obtained by the method of hartree andwomersley .  in applying this method the derivativesparallel to the boundary are replaced by finite differences, sothat the partial differential equation of the boundarylayer is replaced by an ordinary equation relating the velocitydistribution through the boundary layer at one sectionto that at another, at an interval upstream .  by two independentintegrations covering the same range by finite intervalsof different sizes, it is possible to estimate the errorsinvolved in replacing the derivatives by finite differences,and so to correct for these errors .  the process of solution requires the values of the pressuregradient along the solid boundary, and there is a certaintolerance in the derivation of the pressure gradient distributionfrom a limited number of observed values of pressure .an analysis of schubauer's pressure distribution is outlined, andthe results were used for the main solution calculated .it is found that the solution, for the distribution of pressure gradientso derived, does not give separation of the boundarylayer from the solid boundary, whereas the actual flow does separate .  it is found that the calculated solution is very sensitive tothe pressure distribution, and a comparatively smallmodification of the pressure distribution gives a solution whichdoes indicate separation close to the point at whichseparation is observed to occur .  the solution with this pressuredistribution also gives very good agreement with theobserved velocity distribution through the boundary layer atpoints upstream from separation .
