engineering relations for friction and heat transfer to surfaces in high velocity flow ..Aeckert, e..Bj. aero. sc. v.22, august 1955, pp 585-587.Wengineering relations for friction and heat transfer to surfaces in high velocity flow .in calculations of thermodynamic heating for high speed missilesparameters have been used based on relationships which hold forconstant-property fluids . the validity of this procedure has been verifiedrecently in a survey of heat transfer in which a relationship for thereference temperature was developed . a calculation procedure forlaminar and turbulent boundary layers, based on this relationship, isgiven .
