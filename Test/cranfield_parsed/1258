heat transfer, recovery factor and pressure distributionsaround a circular cylinder normal to a supersonic rarefiedair stream ..Atewfik,o.k. and giedt,w.h..Bj. ae. scs. 1960, 721..Wheat transfer, recovery factor and pressure distributionsaround a circular cylinder normal to a supersonic rarefiedair stream .  measurements of the heat transfer, recovery factor, andpressure distributions around a circular cylinder normal to asupersonic rarefied-air stream (total temperature 300 k.)are described for the mach number range of 1.3 to 5.7, thereynolds number range of 37 to 4,100 and at cylinder wallaverage temperature levels of 90 k. and 210 k .  study of theresults yielded ..  (1) a correlation equation for thestagnation-point nusselt number as a function of the reynolds number justafter the normal part of the detached bow shock wave,. and (2)fourier series expressions for the heat-transfer coefficient andpressure coefficient distributions in terms of the stagnation pointvalues .  in comparing these measurements with predictions based onrecent analytical studies, exceptionally good agreement for theheat-transfer coefficient distribution was obtained with lees'theory .  in the mach number range of 3.55 to 5.73 thepressure decreased less rapidly with distance from the stagnation pointthan predicted by the modified newtonian theory .
