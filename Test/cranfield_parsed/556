numerical comparison between exact and approximatetheories of hypersonic inviscid flow past slender bluntnosed bodies ..Afeldman,s..Bars j. 30, 1960..Wnumerical comparison between exact and approximatetheories of hypersonic inviscid flow past slender bluntnosed bodies .  this paper presents numerical results ofexact calculations of the inviscid equilibrium flow abouta long hemisphere-cylinder in motionat hypersonic velocity .  a comparison is made with blastwave as well as free layer theories of hypersonicflow .  as a result of the comparison, it is concludedthat the second-order blast wave theory canbe used for the purpose of finding the shock shape andthe body pressure distribution .  however,this procedure is definitely empirical and cannot bejustified on rational or theoretical grounds .we show that the presently calculated radial distributionof energy is radically different than thatgiven by blast wave theory .  if body shapes other thanthose considered here are of interest, theonly reliable approach at the present time is to carry outnumerical calculations .  it was foundthat for certain flight velocities the pressure on the bodydoes not decay to free stream pressuremonotonically but overexpands .
