some design problems of hovercraft ..Astanton-jones,r..Binst. aero. sc. paper 61-45, 1961..Wsome design problems of hovercraft .analysis of the influence various aerodynamic parameters have onthe performance of a simple peripheral jet system .  power weightratio, lift drag ratio, and effect of jet angles and thickness areeach considered .  structural requirements, optimum cushionpressure, and dynamic stability over waves are examined and thenrelated to the economics of ground-effect machine operation .
