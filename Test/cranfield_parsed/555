closing reply to comments on generalized heat transferformulas and graphs for nose cone re-entry into theatmosphere ..Ahidalgo,h..Bars j. 1962..Wclosing reply to comments on generalized heat transferformulas and graphs for nose cone re-entry into theatmosphere .in a recent paper (1), detra and hidalgo have shownthat, when the boundary layer is turbulent, the heatflux per unit area at the sonic point of a nose cone may exceedthe corresponding laminar heat flux per unit area at thestagnation point .  the ratio of turbulent sonic-point tolaminar stagnation-point heat flux per unit area has beenestimated (2) to vary from about 1.0 to 10 for a hemisphericalnose as the reynolds number (based on nose diameter)increases from 10 to 10 .  since for an axisymmetric bodythe surface area in the vicinity of the sonic point greatlyexceeds the area in the vicinity of the stagnation point, theratio of turbulent to laminar heat fluxes to the entire bodywill be much greater than the above quoted ratios of heatfluxes per unit area .
