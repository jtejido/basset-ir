buckling of sandwich under normal pressure ..Ayao,j.c..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 264..Wbuckling of sandwich under normal pressure .  a theoretical study is made of the buckling of a sandwich spherecomprised of a core layer of low-modulus material and two thinfacing layers of higher modulus material .  the solution for thebuckling resistance of the sphere under normal external pressureis obtained by linearized theory, and is reducible to the classicalsolution for monocoque spherical shells .  critical bucklingpressures are calculated for various radius-thickness ratios and spherematerials .
