the blasius equation with three-point boundary conditions ..Anapolitano, i. g..Bquart. appl. math. v. 16, no. 4, pp 397-408, 1958 ..Wthe blasius equation with three-point boundary conditions .the blasius equation subject to three-point boundary conditions,describing the interaction between two parallel streams, is solved by wayof a series in terms of ascending powers of the ratio equals /u1 -dashu2//u1, where the u1's are the outer streams' velocities .the first three terms of the series are analytically expressed in termsof the repeated integrals of the complementary error function /im erfc /and of the repeated integrals of the square of the successive integralsof the complementary error function /jmin erfc n/ . these functionsoften appear in problems leading to extended heat-conduction type ofequations . a recurrence formula for jmin erfc n is established andformulae relating the functions in erfc /-dashn/ and jmjn erfc toavailable tabulated values of the functions in erfc /n/ are derived .the first three approximations to the blasius function and to its firsttwo derivatives are also presented in tabulated form with foursignificant figures . test on the convergence of the series has been made bycomparison with some exact solutions obtained by high speed computingmachine . the comparison, extended to the physically essentialquantities, shows that ..second and first derivatives .yield extremely accurate results . the errors in the first twoderivatives of the blasius functions are always contained within less than one per cent .
