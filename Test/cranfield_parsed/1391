shock wave and flow field development in hypersonic re-entry ..Aprobstein, r.f..Bars. j. 31, 185-194, 1961 ..Wshock wave and flow field development in hypersonic re-entry .a study is made of when and how a shock wave and continuum-type flowfield develop in the nose region of a highly cooled blunt body re-entering the atmosphere at hypersonic speed and in a free molecular flowregime . the various types of flow regimes encountered down to lowaltitude conditions are delineated, and the nature of the flow field andbehavior of some of the aerodynamic characteristics are discussed . itis shown that for a highly cooled body, free molecule flow conditionsoccur at a higher altitude than previously indicated . based onavailable evidence, it is suggested that kinetic theory solutions, which areessentially modified free molecule results, along with the navier-stokes equations with no surface slip, serve to define all of the flow regimes except for a narrow transitional layer regime which has a height ofless than one factor of 10 in free stream density change . it is alsosuggested that the appearance of a definable shock wave occurs veryrapidly in terms of density change near the beginning of thetransitional layer regime, and that its location, as in continuum flow, isgoverned principally by the body geometry, whereas its thickness isdetermined by a local mean free path .
