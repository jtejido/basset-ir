some possibilities of using gas mixtures other than inaerodynamic research ..Adean r. chapman.B.Wsome possibilities of using gas mixtures other than inaerodynamic research .a study is made of the advantages that can be realized incompressible-flow research by employing a substitute heavy gas in place of air .most heavy gases considered in previous investigations are either toxic,chemically active, or (as in the case of the freons) have a ratio ofspecific heats greatly different from air .  the present report is basedon the idea that by properly mixing a heavy monatomic gas with asuitable heavy polyatomic gas, it is possible to obtain a heavy gasmixture which has the correct ratio of specific heats and which isnontoxic, nonflammable, thermally stable, chemically inert, andcomprised of commercially available components .calculations were made of wind-tunnel characteristics for 63 gas pairscomprising 21 different polyatomic gases properly mixed with each ofthree monatomic gases (argon, krypton, and xenon) .  for a givenmach number, reynolds number, and tunnel pressure, a gas-mixturewind tunnel having the same specific-heat ratio as air would beappreciably smaller and would require much less power than acorresponding air wind tunnel .  analogous though different advantagescan be realized in compressor research and in firing-range research .the most significant applications, perhaps, arise through selecting andproportioning a gas mixture so as to have at ordinary wind-tunneltemperatures certain dimensionless characteristics which air atflight temperatures possesses but which air at ordinary wind-tunneltemperatures does not possess .  characteristics which involve therelaxation time (or bulk viscosity), the variation of viscosity withtemperature, and the variation of specific heat with temperature fallwithin this category .  other applications arise in heat-transferresearch since certain gas mixtures can be concocted to have any prandtlnumber in the range at least between 0.2 and 0.8 .
