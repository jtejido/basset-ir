several approximate analyses of the bending of a rectangularcantilever plate by uniform normal pressure ..Anash,w.a..Bj.app.mech. 1952, 33..Wseveral approximate analyses of the bending of a rectangularcantilever plate by uniform normal pressure .  three methods of approximating the deflections andmoments occurring in a rectangular cantilever platesubjected to uniform normal pressure over its entire surfaceare presented in this paper .  the first is the application ofthe well-known finite-difference procedure .  the secondand third are collocation methods, one based uponpolynomial solutions of the lagrange equation, the otheremploying /mixed/ hyperbolic-trigonometric termssatisfying this equation .  in the last two methods the boundaryconditions are satisfied exactly along the clamped edge andat a finite number of points along the free edges of the plate .the results obtained for the particular case of a cantileverplate with uniform normal load indicate that the use of arelatively small number of points in the collocationmethod yields values of deflections and moments that arein substantial agreement with those given by thefinite-difference procedure .  it cannot be concluded from theseresults that the collocation method using the assumedfunctions will give satisfactory results with fewer pointsthan the finite-difference method for cantilever plates withloading different from the one investigated .
