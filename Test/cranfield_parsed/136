recent developments in rocket nozzle configurations ..Aroa,g.v.r..Ba.r.s.jnl. 31, 1961,1488..Wrecent developments in rocket nozzle configurations .  existing configurations of supersonic portion of rocket nozzlesare described and compared .  survey covers bell-type conical andcontoured nozzles, annular nozzles, plug nozzles, and the author'sown /e-d/ (expansion-deflection) nozzle .  the latter is abell-type nozzle in which the gases are first deflected radially outwardby a small central plug, then expanded radially inward around thebase of the plug, and finally deflected back to a nearly axialdirection by the nozzle wall, in compressive turning .
