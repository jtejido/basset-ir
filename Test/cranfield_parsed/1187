shock-induced boundary layer separation in overexpanded conical exhaustnozzles ..Aarens, m. and spiegler, e.Baiaa journal, march 1963. p.578 ..Wshock-induced boundary layer separation in overexpanded conical exhaustnozzles .the flow in overexpanded supersonic nozzles is reviewed . although fiveessentially different flow regimes can be discerned, depending on thenozzle pressure ratio, the regime of most interest to the enginedesigner is the one characterized by oblique shock patterns in the nozzleand flow separation from the nozzle wall . it is shown that the pressure rise associated with the separation correlates well with the machnumber at the separation point . a simple analytical formulation for thepressure rise required to separate the flow provides excellent agreement with experimental data over a wide range of nozzle operating conditions and allows prediction of overexpanded nozzle performance .
