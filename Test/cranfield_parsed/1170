structural loads surveys on two tilt-wing vtol configurations ..Award,j.f..Bnasa tn.d729, 1961..Wstructural loads surveys on two tilt-wing vtol configurations .  the results of two structural-loadssurveys are summarized .  thefirst loads program discussed concernsthe airframe vibratory loadsencountered during flight tests of thevz-2 tilt-wing vtol aircraftthroughout the operational range fromhover to cruise flight .  theprimary sources of airframe vibrationwere wing-stall buffeting andtail buffeting in descents .  the secondloads program discussedconcerns the initial results of astructural-loads survey conducted aspart of the wind-tunnel test of alarge-scale tilt-wing research model .this loads program deals with thesteady wing loads measured throughoutsimulated transition from hover tocruise .
