study of effects of sweep on the flutter of cantileverwings ..Abarmby,j.g..Bnaca r.1014, 1951..Wstudy of effects of sweep on the flutter of cantileverwings .  an experimental and analytical investigation of the flutterof sweptback cantilever wings is reported .  the experimentsemployed groups of wings swept back by rotating and byshearing .  the angle of sweep ranged from 0 to 60 andmach numbers extended to approximately 0.85 .  a theoreticalanalysis of the air forces on an oscillating swept wing of highlength-chord ratio is developed, and the approximationsinherent in the assumptions are discussed .  comparison withexperiment indicates that the analysis developed in the presentreport is satisfactory for giving the main effects of sweep, atleast for nearly uniform cantilever wings of high and moderatelength-chord ratios .  a separation of the effects of finite spanand compressibility in their relation to sweep has not been madeexperimentally but some combined effects are given .  adiscussion of some of the experimental and theoretical trends isgiven with the aid of several tables and figures .
