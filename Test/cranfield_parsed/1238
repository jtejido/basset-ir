the newtonian approximation in magnetic hypersonicstagnation-point flow ..Alykoudis,p.s..Bj. ae. scs. 1961..Wthe newtonian approximation in magnetic hypersonicstagnation-point flow .  the hypersonic flow of an electrically conducting fluid aroundthe stagnation region of a sphere carrying a radial magnetic fieldis examined .  by assuming a newtonian pressure distribution and constantdensity, the differential equation of the inviscid flow is integratedand a simple closed-form solution is obtained .  it is found that the ratio of the stand-off distances of the shockwave for the magnetic and nonmagnetic cases does not dependexplicitly on the magnetic parameter s (ratio of the ponderomotiveforce to the free-stream inertia force) nor on the density ratio (thevalue at the free stream divided by the value behind the shockwave) but on the product s at least for values of betweenand .  the velocity gradient on the body is also calculated and theratio of the magnetic to the nonmagnetic case is shown to dependon the parameter .  the case of cylindrical shocks is also examined,. the samegeneral conclusions are drawn .
