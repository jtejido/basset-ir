wind tunnel investigation of the static and dynamic stabilitycharacteristics of a 10degree semivertex angle blunted cone ..Awehrend, w.r..Bnasa tn d-1202, 1962 ..Wwind tunnel investigation of the static and dynamic stabilitycharacteristics of a 10degree semivertex angle blunted cone .the static and dynamic stability characteristics of a blunted 10degreesemivertex angle cone were studied . the cone which had a modifiedspherical segment nose was tested with a flat base and with a truncatedconical base .all tests were performed in air at mach numbers from 0.65 to 2.20 withthe angle-of-attack range from -4degree to +18degree . presented aremeasurements of the normal force, axial force, base pressure, andpitching moment from the static tests, and the damping-in-pitch momentfrom the dynamic tests .both models had satisfactory stability characteristics throughout thetest mach number range but the addition of the conical afterbody had alarge destabilizing effect .
