some effects of bluntness on boundary layer transitionand heat transfer at supersonic speeds ..Amoeckel,w.e..Bnaca r.1312, 1957..Wsome effects of bluntness on boundary layer transitionand heat transfer at supersonic speeds .  large downstream movements of transition observed when theleading edge of a hollow cylinder or a flat plate is slightlyblunted are explained in terms of the reduction in reynoldsnumber at the outer edge of the boundary layer due to thedetached shock wave .  the magnitude of this reduction iscomputed for cones and wedges for mach numbers to 20 .concurrent changes in outer-edge mach number and temperature occurin the direction that would increase the stability of the laminarboundary layer .  the hypothesis is made that transition reynolds number issubstantially unchanged when a sharp leading edge or tip isblunted .  this hypothesis leads to the conclusion that thedownstream movement of transition is inversely proportional tothe ratio of surface reynolds number with blunted tip orleading edge to surface reynolds number with sharp tip or leadingedge .  this conclusion is in good agreement with thehollow-cylinder result at mach 3.1 .  application of this hypothesis to other mach numbers yieldsthe result that blunting the tip of a slender cone or the leadingedge of a thin wedge should produce downstream movements oftransition by factors ranging from 2 at mach 3.0 to 30 at machthe possible reduction in over-all heat-transfer rate and frictiondrag for aircraft flying at high supersonic speeds .  mach number profiles near the surfaces of blunted cones andwedges are computed for an assumed shape of the detachedshock wave at flight mach numbers to 20 .  the dissipation andstability of these profiles are discussed, and a method isdescribed for estimating the amount of blunting required to producethe maximum possible downstream movement of transition .
