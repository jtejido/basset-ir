supersonic flow past oscillating airfoils includingnonlinear thickness effects ..Avan dyke,m.d..Bnaca r1183, 1954..Wsupersonic flow past oscillating airfoils includingnonlinear thickness effects .  a solution to second order in thickness is derived forharmonically oscillating two-dimensional airfoils in supersonicflow .  for slow oscillations of an arbitrary profile, the result isfound as a series including the third power of frequency .  forarbitrary frequencies, the method of solution for any specificprofile is indicated, and the explicit solution derived for a singlewedge .  nonlinear thickness effects are found generally to reduce thetorsional damping, and so to enlarge the range of mach numberswithin which torsional instability is possible .  thisdestabilizing effect varies only slightly with frequency in the rangeinvolved in dynamic stability analysis, but may reverse to astabilizing effect at high flutter frequencies .  comparison witha previous solution exact in thickness suggests that nonlineareffects of higher than second order are practically negligible .  the analysis utilizes a smoothing technique that replacesthe actural problem by one involving no kinked streamlines .this stratagem eliminates all consideration of shock wavesfrom the analysis, yet yields the correct solution for problemsthat actually contain shock waves .
