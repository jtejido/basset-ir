heat transfer at the forward stagnation point of bluntbodies ..Areshotko,e. and cohen,c.b..Bnaca tn.3513, 1955..Wheat transfer at the forward stagnation point of bluntbodies .  relations are presented for the calculation of heat transfer atthe forward stagnation point of both two-dimensional and axiallysymmetric blunt bodies .  the relations for the heat transfer, which wereobtained from exact solutions to the equations of the laminar boundarylayer, are presented in terms of the local velocity gradient at thestagnation point .  these exact solutions include effects of variationof fluid properties, prandtl number, and transpiration cooling .examples illustrating the calculation procedure are also included .
