transition measurements on cones in free flight ballisticsrange tests ..Alyons,w.c..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 352..Wtransition measurements on cones in free flight ballisticsrange tests .  navy-sponsored experimental investigation of the location ofboundary-layer transition on sharp-nosed cones having 10 totalangles .  the ambient temperature in a portion of the aeroballisticsrange is varied so as to obtain different adiabatic recoverytemperatures at a constant nominal mach number of 3.1 .  the locationof transition is expressed as a transition reynolds number, andresults are presented graphically as a function of the ratio betweenthe wall temperature and the adiabatic recovery temperature .
