integration of the boundary layer equations ..Ameksyn,d..Bproc.roy.s.a. 237 1956, 543..Wintegration of the boundary layer equations .the equations of the boundary layerare integrated by an expression of the formwhere f(x) is a positive function with x=0as the stationary point,. (x) is slowly varying,.the integral contains an unknown parameterwhich is found from the condition .  the integral is evaluated by the method ofsteepest descent .  the expressions obtained areusually divergent, except in few cases whichinclude blasius's equation,. the divergentexpressions are summed by euler's transformation .  to check the procedure it is applied to falknerand skan's equation .  the results obtainedare very striking,. few terms in the expansionsare sufficient to obtain close agreement withhartree's laborious numerical computations .  the method is also applied to the generalboundary-layer equation for the case of flow pastan elliptic cylinder, measured by schubauer .the results obtained are in close agreementwith schubauer's measurements for the velocities,almost up to separation, for the position ofthe separation point,. and in satisfactory agreement downstream ofseparation .
