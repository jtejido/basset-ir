generalised-newtonian theory ..Alove,e.s..Bj. ae. scs. 26, 1959, 314..Wgeneralised-newtonian theory .  author generalizes lees's (amr 10(1957), rev. 2601)modification of newtonian theory for blunt-nose bodies to apply to pointed-nose bodies as well .  the result is expressed bysin where is the local inclination of the bodysurface and the subscript /max/ refers to the maximum localinclination and pressure coefficient .  for blunt-nose bodiesand the generalized theory reverts to lees's blunt-nosemodification with given by normal shock relations .  author shows,by comparison of newtonian and generalized-newtonian theorywith exact solutions, the superiority of generalized-newtoniantheory .  he also shows that both two-dimensional andaxisymmetric shapes are correlated by this generalization .  results arepresented in two figures that support author's generalization andindicate the independence of the correlation from variations inboth the hypersonic similarity parameter k = m(d1) and the ratioof specific heats y .  reviewer believes this generalization should be of interest tothose engaged in development of hypersonic hardware as well astheory .
