design and test of mixed-flow impellers, viii - comparison ofexperimental results for three impellers with shroud redesigned by rapidapproximate method ..Aosborn, w.m. et al..Bnaca rm e56l07, 1957 ..Wdesign and test of mixed-flow impellers, viii - comparison ofexperimental results for three impellers with shroud redesigned by rapidapproximate method .three centrifugal impellers with parabolic, circular, andskewed-parabolic blading were modified by a recently developed design procedure to reduce the velocity gradients along the hub from inlet to outlet .all original dimensions except the shroud contours were retained .experimental investigation showed that the modified impellers had betterperformance characteristics than the original impellers at all speedsinvestigated, the greatest gains occurring at speeds of 1300 feet persecond and higher . these large gains probably resulted primarily frommore favorable velocity gradients and from designing these impellersfurther away from the condition necessary for eddy formation . themodified impellers were thus able to operate over a wider range ofweight flows at high speeds .the modified impellers were investigated over a range of equivalentspeeds of 900 to 1500 feet per second and flow rates from maximum to the point of incipient surge . at 1300 feet per second, the peak pressureratio and maximum adiabatic temperature-rise efficiency for theparabolic-bladed impeller were 3.07 and 0.825, respectively . for the sameconditions, the circular-bladed impeller and the skewed-parabolic-bladed impeller had pressure ratios of 3.13 and 3.15 and efficiencies of 0.737 and 0.805, respectively . of the three, the parabolic-bladed impellerhad the highest maximum efficiencies /0.854 to 0.800/ and the bestweight-flow range over the speed range tested . on the basis of theparameters investigated, it appears that parabolic blading is superiorto circular blading . the experimental results indicate that the designmethod of naca tn 3399 is a reliable method for use in designingcentrifugal impellers .
