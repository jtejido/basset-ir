studies of structural failure due to acoustic loading ..Ahess,n.w..Bnaca tn.4050, 1957..Wstudies of structural failure due to acoustic loading .  some discussion of the acoustic fatigue problem of aircraftstructures is given along with data pertaining to the acoustic inputs fromsome powerplants in common use .  comparisons are given for results ofsome fatigue tests of flat panels and cantilever beams exposed to bothrandom- and discrete-type inputs .  in this regard it appears that boththe stress level of the test and the type of model are significant,.hence, no generalization can be made at this time .  with regard toincreasing the fatigue life, it was noted that increased stiffening ofa panel due to curvature and pressure differential is particularlybeneficial .
