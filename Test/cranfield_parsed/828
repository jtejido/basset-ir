stresses and small displacements of shallow sphericalshells ..Areissner,e..Bj. math. phys. 25, 1946, 80..Wstresses and small displacements of shallow sphericalshells .  the purpose of the present paper is to derive a system ofequations which can be used for the analysis of shallow segments ofthin, elastic, spherical shells .  a segment will be called shallow ifthe ratio of its height to base diameter is less than, say .  theresults obtained on the basis of this assumption will often also beapplicable to shells which are not shallow, namely then, when the loadsare such that the stresses are effectively restricted to shallow zones .  the problem of the spherical elastic shell has been the subject ofnumerous researches .  for the rotationally symmetric case thefundamental results were obtained in 1912 (1) and have been the startingpoint of many applications .  while it is possible to deduce from theseresults approximate equations equivalent to part of what follows, it isbelieved that the present approach to the problem of the shallow shellmay be of some interest even for rotationally symmetric cases .  a number of investigations have been concerned with the shell loadedin a non-rotationally symmetric manner (2,3,4) .  in its general formthis problem is quite difficult and the results so far obtained are noteasy to apply .  restricting attention to the shallow shell in themanner of the present paper brings with it a very considerablesimplification of the analysis .
