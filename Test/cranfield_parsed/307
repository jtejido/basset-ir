an approximate solution of hypersonic laminar boundarylayer equations and its application ..Anagakura,t. and naruse,h..Bj. phys. soc. japan, 12, 1957, 1298..Wan approximate solution of hypersonic laminar boundarylayer equations and its application .  approximate formulae of the displacement thickness and the skinfriction of the hypersonic laminar boundary layer are derived by use ofvon karman's integral method, assuming the heat-insulated wall, theprandtl number of unity and chapman and rubesin's formula for thevariation of viscosity with temperature .the results obtained arecompared with some exact solutions .because of the good agreement, itseems that these formulae are very useful .  these formulae, together with the tangent-wedge-approximation, areapplied to the viscous flow overslender bodies with a sufficiently sharpleading edge .  as an example, thepressure distribution over a flat plateis calculated numerically over theentire region of the surface .comparison with other author's theoreticalresults as well as experimentalvalues is made .
