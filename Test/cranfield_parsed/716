study of the oscillatory motion of manned vehiclesentering the earth's atmosphere ..Asommer,s.c. and tobak,m..Bnasa memo 3-2-59a, 1959..Wstudy of the oscillatory motion of manned vehiclesentering the earth's atmosphere .  an analysis is made of the oscillatorymotion of vehicles whichtraverse arbitrarily prescribed trajectoriesthrough the atmosphere .expressions for the oscillatory motionare derived as continuous functionsof the properties of the trajectory .  results are applied to a study ofthe oscillatory behavior of re-entryvehicles which have decelerations thatremain within limits of humantolerance .  it is found that a deficiency ofaerodynamic damping for suchvehicles may have more serious consequencesthan it does for comparableballistic missiles .
