the interaction between boundary layer and shock waves in transonicflow ..Aliepmann, h. w..Bj. aero. sc. v. 13, december, 1946 ..Wthe interaction between boundary layer and shock waves in transonicflow .experiments of transonic flow past a circular arc profile show that theshock-wave pattern and the pressure distribution are strongly dependentupon the state of the boundary layer . a change from laminar toturbulent boundary layer at a given mach number changes the flow pattern considerably .shock waves can interact with the boundary layer in a manner similar toa reflection from a free jet boundary . these shock waves are notdistinctly discernible from pressure distribution measurements .
