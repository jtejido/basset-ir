on the conservativeness of various distributed force systems ..Asol r. bodner.Bassistant professor of engineering, brown university, providence,r.i..Won the conservativeness of various distributed force systems .the necessity of determining the conservativeness of force systems ininstability problems is discussed in reference 1 .  it is shown that,whereas kinetic methods are generally applicable for the determinationof instability loads, the statical methods usually employed are validonly for conservative and nongyroscopic systems .  small changes inthe character of the loading could make an otherwise conservativesystem nonconservative and cause a large change in the magnitude of thebuckling load .  the buckling load of the cantilever column examplein reference 1 is, for tangential end loading, eight times that forconservative, constant directional loading .
