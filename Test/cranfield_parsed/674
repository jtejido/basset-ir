the shapes and lift-dependent drags on some sweptbackwings designed for m= 1. 2..Abagley,j.a. and beasley,j.a..Brae r. aero.2620, 1959..Wthe shapes and lift-dependent drags on some sweptbackwings designed for m= 1. 2.  the camber and twist distributionsneeded to produce a constantspan-wise -distribution and certain linearchordwise load distributions havebeen calculated by linearised supersonictheory at for a set of 34thin sweptback wings .  the wing planformscover a range of aspect ratiosfrom 2.0 to 3.5 and leading-edge sweepangles from 55 to 70 .  both leadingand trailing edges are subsonic at thedesign mach number, and theslenderness parameter is between 0.19 and 0.40 .  the lift-dependent vortex and wavedrags associated with these loadingshave also been calculated, and appear notto be excessive in almost all thecases considered .
