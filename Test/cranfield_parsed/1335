use of freon-12 as a fluid for aerodynamic testing ..Ahuber,p.w..Bnaca tn.1024, 1946..Wuse of freon-12 as a fluid for aerodynamic testing .  the thermodynamic propertiesof freon-12 have beeninvestigated to determine thepossibilities of the useof this gas as a fluid foraerodynamic testing .  thevalues of velocity of soundin freon-12, which are lessthan one-half those in air,are presented as functionsof temperatures and pressure,including measurements atroom temperature .  the densityof freon-12 is aboutfour times that of air .  changesin state of freon-12may be predicted by means of theideal gas law with anaccuracy of better than 1 percentat pressures belowfreon-12 is shown notto condense during an adiabaticexpansion from normalconditions up to a mach numberof 3 .  the values of theratio of specific heatsfor freon-12 are lower thanthat for air, and thereforean additional parameter isintroduced, which must beconsidered when comparisonsare made of aerodynamic testsusing freon-12 with thoseusing air .  the time lag of thevibrational heat capacityof freon-12 to a change intemperature has beenmeasured and found to beof the order of 2 x 10 secondat atmospheric temperatureand pressure .  this timeis so short that no importantenergy dissipationsshould result in mostengineering applications .
