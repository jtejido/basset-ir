investigation of the flow through a single stage twodimensional nozzle in the langley 11in . hypersonictunnel ..Amclellan,c.h..Bnaca tn.2223, 1950..Winvestigation of the flow through a single stage twodimensional nozzle in the langley 11in . hypersonictunnel .  flow surveys have been made inthe second of several nozzles to beinvestigated in the langley 11-inchhypersonic tunnel .  the single-stage,two-dimensional nozzle was designedby the method of characteristics fora mach number of 7.08 withoutboundary-layer corrections .  the test results show thatreasonably uniform flow at an averagemach number of about 6.86 wasobtained in a central region of the streamat the test section .  this regionhad a cross section nearly 5 inchessquare and had a deviation fromuniform flow of less than 1 percent inmach number and 0.3 in flow angle .an increase in mach number ofabout 3 percent occurred during testruns of about 60 seconds durationbecause of distortions of the boundariesat the first minimum due tononuniform heating of the nozzle blocksduring the tests .
