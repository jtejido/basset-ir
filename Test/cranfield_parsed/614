the contraction of satellite orbits under the influence of air drag ..Apart ii . with oblate atmosphere ..Bking-hele, d.g., cook, g.e. and walker, d.m.c.r.a.e. tn. gw. 565. 1960 ..Wthe contraction of satellite orbits under the influence of air drag .part ii . with oblate atmosphere .the effect of air drag on satellite orbits of small eccentricity e/0.2/was studied in part i/technical note no.g.w.533/on the assumption thatthe atmosphere was spherically symmetrical . here the theory is extended to an atmosphere in which the surfaces of constant density arespheroids of arbitrary small ellipticity . equations are derived whichshow how perigee distance and orbital period vary with eccentricity, and how eccentricity is related to time . expressions are also obtainedwhich give lifetime and air density at perigee in terms of the rate ofchange of period . in most of the equations, terms of order e and higher are neglected . the results take different forms according as theeccentricity is greater or less than about 0.025, while circular orbitsare dealt with in a separate section . the results are also presentedgraphically in a manner designed for practical application, and examples of the theory in use are given .the influence of atmospheric oblateness is difficult to summarize fairlysimultaneously assume their'worst'values, some of thespherical-atmosphere results can be altered by up to 30( as a result of oblatenessand 5-10( would be a more representative figure .
