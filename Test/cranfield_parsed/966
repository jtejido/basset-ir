on fully developed channel flows,. some solutions and limitations, andeffects of compressibility, variable properties, and body forces ..Amaslen, s.h..Bnasa tr r-34, 1959.Won fully developed channel flows,. some solutions and limitations, andeffects of compressibility, variable properties, and body forces .an examination of the effects of compressibility, variable properties,and body forces on fully developed laminar flows has indicated severallimitations on such streams .in the absence of a pressure gradient, but presence of a body forceliquid this follows also for the case of a constant streamwise pressuregradient . these motions are exact in the sense of a couette flow . inthe liquid case two solutions /not a new result/ can occur for the sameboundary conditions . an approximate analytic solution was found whichagrees closely with machine calculations .in the case of approximately exact flows, it turns out that for largetemperature variations across the channel the effects of convection /due to, say, a wall temperature gradient/ and frictional heating must benegligible . in such a case the energy and momentum equations areseparated, and the solutions are readily obtained . if the temperaturevariations are small, then both convection effects and frictionalheating can consistently be considered . this case becomes theconstant-property incompressible case /or quasi-incompressible case forfree-convection flows/ considered by many authors .finally, there is a brief discussion of cases wherein streamwisevariations of all quantities are allowed but only in such form that theindependent variables are separable . for the case where the streamwisevelocity varies inversely as the square root of distance along thechannel, a solution is given .
