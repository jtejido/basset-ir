preliminary analysis of axial flow compressors havingsupersonic velocity at the entrance of the stator ..Aferri,a..Bnaca rm l9g06, 1949..Wpreliminary analysis of axial flow compressors havingsupersonic velocity at the entrance of the stator .  a supersonic compressor design having supersonic velocity at theentrance of the stator is analyzed on the assumption of two-dimensionalflow .  the rotor and stator losses assumed in the analysis are based onthe results of preliminary supersonic cascade tests .  the results ofthe analysis show that compression ratios per stage of 6 to 10 can beobtained with adiabatic efficiency between 70 and 80 percent .  consideration is also given in the analysis to the starting,stability, and range of efficient performance of this type ofcompressor .  the desirability of employing variable-geometry statorsand adjustable inlet guide vanes is indicated .  although eithersupersonic or subsonic axial component of velocity at the statorentrance can be used, the cascade test results suggest that higherpressure recovery can be obtained if the axial component is supersonic .
