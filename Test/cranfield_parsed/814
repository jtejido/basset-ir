stability derivatives of cones at supersonic speeds ..Atobak,m. and wehrend,w.r..Bnaca tn.3788, 1956..Wstability derivatives of cones at supersonic speeds .  the aerodynamic stability derivatives due to pitching velocity andvertical acceleration are calculated by use of potential theory forcircular cones traveling at supersonic speeds .  the analysis is based ontwo theoretical techniques used successfully previously in applicationto the case of uniform axial and inclined flow .  in the first,potential solutions for axial flow and crossflow are derived from thefirst-order wave equation but in application to calculations for theforces no approximations are made either to the tangency condition orto the isentropic pressure relation .  the second method consists incombining the first-order crossflow potential with an axial-flowpotential correct to second order .  closed-form solutions by bothmethods are found for a cone, and numerical results for the stabilityderivatives are presented as a function of mach number for cones havingsemivertex angles of 10 and 20 .  in addition, expressions for the forces, moments, and stabilityderivatives of arbitrary bodies of revolution are obtained usingnewtonian impact theory .  numerical results for cones compare wellwith those obtained from the combined first- and second-order potentialtheory at the highest mach number for which the latter theory isapplicable .
