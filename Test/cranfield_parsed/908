random vibration ..Acrandal,s..Bapp. mech. rev. 12, 1959, 739..Wrandom vibration .  random vibration is vibration which resultsfrom an excitation which is not well represented by any simplefunction (sinusoid, step, etc.) or any simple combination ofsuch functions but which is satisfactorily modeled by astochastic process .  it is perhaps not too much of an exaggerationto say that /all vibration is random vibration ./  everyvibration record contains /hash/ at some level .  nevertheless,until recently, engineering vibration theory has been able toget along without including the consideration of randomexcitations .  now in several fields simultaneously there has occurred aburst of activity in the application of random processes .  theresponse of aircraft to buffeting from atmospheric turbulenceand the response of ships to confused seas have been put onreasonably firm footing .  possibly the most dramatic problemshave been posed by the development of large jet and rocketengines which produce spectacular amounts of randomvibrational energy .  the high level of random vibration in a jetplane or a missile provides a severe environment with respectto fatigue failure of structural members and with respect tomalfunctions of sensitive equipment .
