calculation of the flow past slender delta wings withleading edge separation ..Amangler,k.w. and smith,j..Brae r. aero.2593, 1957..Wcalculation of the flow past slender delta wings withleading edge separation .  the flow past a slender deltawing with a sharp leading edge, atincidence, usually separates alongthis edge, i.e. a vortex layer extendsfrom the edge and rolls up to forma /core/ (a region of high vorticity) .a potential flow model of this isconstructed in which the layer isreplaced by a vortex sheet whichis rolled up into a spiral in the regionof the /core/ .  this problemis reduced to a two-dimensional one byassuming a conical field and usingslender wing theory .  the shape and strengthof the sheet are determined bythe two conditions that it is a streamsurface and sustains no pressuredifference .  use is made of resultspreviously obtained for the coreregion and the remaining finite part ofthe sheet is dealt with by choosingcertain functions for its shape andstrength .  the parameters in thesefunctions are found by satisfying thetwo conditions stated above atisolated points .  results are obtained forthe pressure distribution, chordloading and norman force coefficient asfunctions of the ratio of theincidence to the apex angle .  the lift for agiven incidence is about 15below that found by brown and michael .  flowpatterns are indicated in twotypical cases .  the effect of separation onthe drag due to lift of a wingwith small thickness is discussed .
