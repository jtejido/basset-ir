hypersonic viscous flow over slender cones ..Atalbot,l..Bnaca tn.4327, 1958..Whypersonic viscous flow over slender cones .  viscous self-induced pressures on 3 -semivertex-angle cones weremeasured over the range 3.7 free-stream mach number 5.8 and 0.5viscous-interaction parameter 2.3 .  the data were found to be in goodagreement with results obtained by talbot on 5 cones in the rangerameter 3.5 .  all these data were correlated reasonably well by theviscous-interaction parameter, which is defined aswhere and are the mach number and reynolds number based onideal taylor-maccoll flow conditions and c is the chapman-rubesinfactor .  a new method for calculating self-induced pressures is presentedwhich takes into account the interaction between boundary-layer growthand the inviscid-flow field at the outer edge of the boundary layer .pressures calculated by this method were only 10 to 20 percent higherthan the measured values .
