numerical solutions for supersonic flow of an idealgas around blunt two-dimensional bodies ..Afuller,f.b..Bnasa tn.d791, 1961..Wnumerical solutions for supersonic flow of an idealgas around blunt two-dimensional bodies .  the method described is an inverse one,. the shock shape is chosenand the solution proceeds downstream to a body .  bodies blunter thancircular cylinders are readily accessible, and any adiabatic index canbe chosen .  the lower limit to the free-stream mach number available inany case is determined by the extent of the subsonic field, which inturn depends upon the body shape .  some discussion of the stability ofthe numerical processes is given .  a set of solutions for flows aboutcircular cylinders at several mach numbers and several values of theadiabatic index is included .
