the behaviour of a cylindrical shell under axial compressionwhen the buckling load has been exceeded ..Aleggett,d.m.a. and jones,r.p.n..Barc r + m.2190, 1942..Wthe behaviour of a cylindrical shell under axial compressionwhen the buckling load has been exceeded .  the value of the compressive stress at whicha thin circular cylindrical shell becomes unstable has beenworked out theoretically by southwell (1914) .  subsequentexperimental results, however, have indicated that thisvalue is appreciably too high and that the form of distortionwhich occurs in practice differs from that assumed in theory .  in recent years much work has been done on this problemin america .  lundquist (1933) and donnell (1934)have concluded that the buckling of a cylindrical shell is greatlyinfluenced by initial irregularities,. von karman andtsien (1941) have indicated that a thin cylindrical shell can bemaintained in a buckled state by a compressive loadconsiderably smaller than that previously predicted by theory .  the present paper is an extension of the work of von karmanand tsien .  it shows that the smallest load which willkeep a thin cylindrical shell in a buckled condition is about one-thirdof that given by southwell, a result in very fairagreement with experiment, and that once the cylinder has buckled,and so long as the stresses remain within the elasticrange of the material, the cylinder has only about one-quarter of itsoriginal stiffness .
