an integral method for calculation of supersonic laminarboundary layer with heat transfer on yawed cone ..Ayen,shee-mang and thyson,n.a..Baiaa jnl. 1, 1963, 672..Wan integral method for calculation of supersonic laminarboundary layer with heat transfer on yawed cone .  an integral method for calculating the three-dimensionalboundary layer over the surface ofa cone at angle of attack is investigated .the numerical procedure of integration for thatmethod on the basis of a simplifying assumptionconcerning the boundary layer developmentalong the cone generator is developed and illustratedby applying the method to find thesolutions of integral equations for a specific example .the results obtained for the example for therange of circumferential angle of 40 investigatedare summarized and given as heat transfercoefficients, coefficients of friction, and otherfriction parameters .  the distribution of heattransfer coefficients checked with availableexperimental data fairly well .
