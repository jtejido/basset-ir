interaction of secondary injectants and rocket exhaustfor thrust vector control ..Anewton,j.f. and spaid,f.w..Bars jnl. 32, 1962, 1203..Winteraction of secondary injectants and rocket exhaustfor thrust vector control .  tests were conducted with 1300- to 1500-lb thrustsolid rocket motors in order to investigate theside-force generation mechanisms associated withthe injection of a secondary fluid into theexpansion cone of a solid propellant rocket nozzle forthrust-vector control .  the nozzles were 15conicals with a nominal expansion ratio of .  allfirings were conducted in zero-flow ejectors .freon-12, water, and gascous nitrogen were used asthe injectant .  nozzle-wall pressure profiles,side thrust, and the nozzle-wall shock interface wererecorded .  the general character of thepressure disturbance was defined .  the major portion ofthe side force was generated by the pressuredisturbance downstream of the injector .  theaxial-thrust augmentation generated by theinjectant was calculated .  the effects of nozzle-expansionratio and injector location on the side forcewere clearly illustrated .
