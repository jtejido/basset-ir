note on creep buckling of columns ..A.B.Wnote on creep buckling of columns .  some general topics in elastic stability are discussed .  inparticular, attention is given to the relationship betweenadjacent-equilibrium-position and energy techniques, to the effects ofnonlinearity, and to the sensitivity of certain stability problems to thecharacter of the loading .
