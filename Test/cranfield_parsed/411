data on shape and location of detached shock wavesin cones and sphere ..Aherberle,j.w., wood,g.p. and gooderum,p.b..Bnaca tn.2000, 1950..Wdata on shape and location of detached shock wavesin cones and sphere .  accurate experimental data are given on the shape and the locationof detached shock waves on cones and spheres at mach numbers from 1.17to 1.81 .  the data are correlated to obtain equations that describe theshock waves .  this knowledge of the shock waves should be useful incalculations of the pressure distribution and the pressure drag of thefore part of cones and spheres .  the experimental data on shock wavesare compared with theory .
