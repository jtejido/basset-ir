analytic study of induced pressure on long bodies ofrevolution with varying nose bluntness at hypersonicspeeds ..Avan hise,v..Bnasa r78, 1960..Wanalytic study of induced pressure on long bodies ofrevolution with varying nose bluntness at hypersonicspeeds .  a systematic study of induced pressures on a seriesof bodies of revolution with varying nose bluntnesshas been made by using the method of characteristicsfor a perfect gas .  the fluid mediums investigatedwere air and helium and the mach number rangewas from 5 to 40 .  a study of representative shockshapes was also made .  flow parameters obtainedfrom the blast-wave analogy gave good correlations ofinduced pressures and shock shapes .  theinduced-pressure correlations yielded empirical equations forair and helium which cover the complete range ofnose bluntness considered .  (nose fineness ratiosvaried from 0.4 to 4.)  available experimentalresults were in good agreement with the characteristicssolutions .  properties connected with the concept ofhypersonic similitude enabled correlations of thecalculations to be made with respect to nose shape,mach number, and ratio of specific heats .
