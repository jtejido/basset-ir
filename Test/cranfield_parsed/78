an analytical treatment of aircraft propeller precessioninstability ..Areed,w.h. and bland,s.r..Bnasa tn.d659, 1961..Wan analytical treatment of aircraft propeller precessioninstability .  an analytical investigation is made of a precession-type instabilitywhich can occur in a flexibly supported aircraft-engine-propellercombination .  by means of an idealizedmathematical model which is comprisedof a rigid power-plant system flexiblymounted in pitch and yaw to a fixedbackup structure, the conditions required for neutral stability aredetermined .  the paper also examines the sensitivity of the stabilityboundaries to changes in such parametersas stiffness, damping, andasymmetries in the engine mount, propellerspeed, airspeed, mach number,propeller thrust, and location of pitch and yaw axes .  stability is foundto depend strongly on the damping and stiffness in the system .  with the use of nondimensional charts theoretical stabilityboundaries are compared with experimental results obtained in wind-tunneltests of an aeroelastic airplane model .  in general, the theoreticalresults, which do not account for wing response, show the same trendsas observed experimentally,. however,for a given set of conditionscalculated airspeeds for neutral stabilityare consistently lower than themeasured values .  evidently, this result is due to the fact that wingresponse tends to add damping to the system .
