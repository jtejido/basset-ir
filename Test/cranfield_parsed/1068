instability analysis of cylindrical shells under hydrostaticpressure ..Aherrmann,g..Bnasa tn.d1510, 1962, 239..Winstability analysis of cylindrical shells under hydrostaticpressure .  to determine the elastic bucklingpressure of simply supportedcylindrical shells subjected to lateraland axial hydrostatic forces,various versions of linear bendingtheories have been employed in thepast .  for certain shell dimensions,however, the expressions commonlyused may yield substantially differingresults .  in what follows,recent work on this problem bya. e. armenakas and the writer isbriefly reviewed .  this work consistedprimarily in employing a generalbending theory of circular cylindricalshells under the influence ofinitial stress, developed earlier bythe same authors, to re-examinethe problem mentioned, and compare theresults with those of previousinvestigations .  the outcome was theestablishment of a simple butaccurate expression for the bucklingpressure applicable to a widerange of shell dimensions .
