on axially symmetric, turbulent, compressible mixing in the presenceof initial boundary layer ..Agdalia kleinstein.Bpolytechnic institute of brooklyn, farmingdale, n.y..Won axially symmetric, turbulent, compressible mixing in the presenceof initial boundary layer .recent experimental results have shown that themixing of heterogeneous gases having an initial velocityratio close to unity occurs faster than is predicted by classicaleddy-viscosity theory .  the theoretical analysis of two uniformstreams of different gases but of nearly equal velocity,performed with the usual assumptions for eddy viscosity andprandtl number equal to a constant, shows that mixing willtake place very slowly, i.e., at the rate corresponding tolaminar diffusion .  it has been suggested that the differencebetween analysis and experiment could be attributed to thepresence of a boundary layer in the experiments .  it is thepurpose of this note to show that the use of the classicaleddy-viscosity law, admitting the existence of a boundary layer,is not sufficient to explain the rapid mixing that is observedphysically .  instead, it is shown that rapid mixing can beexplained on the basis of a different eddy-viscosity law, aswas suggested in ref. 1 .  these conclusions are obtainedthrough application of the analysis presented briefly below .
