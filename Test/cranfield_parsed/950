comparison of theoretical and experimental creep bucklingtimes of initially straight, centrally loaded columns ..Ajahsman,w.e. and field,f.a..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 431..Wcomparison of theoretical and experimental creep bucklingtimes of initially straight, centrally loaded columns .  the creep-buckling times of initially straight, centrally loadedcolumns as predicted by the hypotheses of shanley, gerard,and rabotnov and shesterikov are compared with appropriateexperimental data .  it is found that the theoretical predictionsare generally conservative, due possibly to the fact that thehypotheses predict initial instability times while the experimentsnormally record final collapse times .  of the three hypotheses,that of gerard generally gives predictions which agree best withthe experimental data .
