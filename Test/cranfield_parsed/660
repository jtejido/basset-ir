the fundamental solution for small steady three dimensionaldisturbances to a two dimensional parallel shear flow ..Alighthill,m.j..Bj. fluid mech. 3, 1957, 113..Wthe fundamental solution for small steady three dimensionaldisturbances to a two dimensional parallel shear flow .  after a brief review of methods of calculating the flowfields produced by disturbances in rotational basic flows,the author points out a fundamental difficulty in thetreated as a perturbation of the disturbance field thatwould occur if the basic flow were uniform) ..  slowattenuation of the secondary-flow disturbance with distancefrom the obstacle .  the author conjectured (same j. 1the trouble was caused by nonuniform validity of theapproximation sequence in the region far from theobstacle .  the analogy with /stokes' and whitehead'sparadoxes/ is mentioned, and a solution analogous tooseen's is suggested, one in which disturbances, but notthe shear, are assumed to be small .  in this paper, such asolution is found, and is shown to overlap with thesmall-shear, secondary-flow solution .  the basic flow is a parallel,steady, inviscid, two-dimensional shear flow .  the /fundamental solution/ due to a weak source is sought .  the method of fourier transforms is used .  simplesolutions are found for a uniformly sheared basic flow (wherethe result coincides with the secondary-flow solution) andfor an exponential basic-flow profile .  in the general caseit is assumed that the parallel basic flow becomes uniformat, where the x-axis lies in the flow direction .the character of the solution is determined by studyingits hankel transform, especially for the class of flowswhere the total variation of the basic stream speed v(y)is small .  an interpretation in terms of images, due tom. b. glauert, is given, and finally the relationship of thepresent work to theories of the displacement of thestagnation streamline (displacement effect of pitottubes) is discussed .
