elastic stability of simply supported corrugated coresand- wich cylinders ..Aharris,l.a. and baker,e.g..Bnasa tn.d1510, 1962, 331..Welastic stability of simply supported corrugated coresand- wich cylinders .  theoretical buckling coefficientsare obtained for the generalinstability of simply supported, corrugatedcore sandwich circularcylinders under combined loads with the coreoriented parallel to thelongitudinal axis of the cylinder .  bucklingcurves are presented for axialcompression, external lateral pressure,torsion, and some typicalinteractions .  the differential equations ofequilibrium used to obtain thebuckling equations were derived from thesmall deflection equations ofstein and mayer which include the effectof deformation due totransverse shear .  these equations are solvedby galerkin's equation .remarks are made concerning the probablevalidity of the results of thesmall deflection theory for sandwich shells .
