clamped short oval cylindrical shells under hydrostaticpressure ..Avafakos,w.p..Bj. ae.scs. 29, 1962, 1347..Wclamped short oval cylindrical shells under hydrostaticpressure .  the principle of the minimum of the total potential isemployed to obtain stresses and displacements for clamped, short,oval cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure .  classicalshell theory, in which buckling effects are not considered, wasused .  a fourier series is assumed for the deflections in theclosed circumferential direction so that the partial differentialequations of equilibrium are replaced by a set of ordinarydifferential equations .  the energy solution is compared with asimplified approximation which can be considered an equivalent circularcylinder solution .  graphs of the significant stresses anddisplacements are presented for oval cylinders having major to minoraxis ratios of 1.10, 1.30, and 1.50 .  it is shown that the maximumstresses and displacements increase significantly as the major tominor axis ratio is increased .
