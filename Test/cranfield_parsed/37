a new technique for investigating heat transfer andsurface phenomena under hypersonic flow conditions ..Aferri,a. and libby,p.a..Bj. ae. scs. 24, 1957, 464..Wa new technique for investigating heat transfer andsurface phenomena under hypersonic flow conditions .on the forebody of many practically interesting hypersonicvehicles, there is little interaction between the inviscidflow field and the boundary layer .  therefore, inviscid flow theorycan be used to determine, independent of surface phenomena,the physically interesting quantities such as shock shape, shockdetachment distance, sonic line shape, and pressure distribution .furthermore, the pressure distribution so determined can then beused for the study of heat transfer, materials behavior, and othersurface phenomena .  thus, for these bodies, the prandtlboundary-layer concept can be utilized for the calculation of both theinviscid flow and the boundary-layer behavior .  it is the purpose of this note to point out that this concept canalso be applied experimentally in order to provide, inconjunction with a conventional hypersonic wind-tunnel air supply, ameans for investigating hypersonic heat transfer and surfacephenomena under conditions of flight reynolds numbers .
