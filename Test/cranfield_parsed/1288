analysis of the fluid mechanics of secondary injectionfor thrust vector control ..Abroadwell,j.e..Baiaa jnl. 1963, 1067..Wanalysis of the fluid mechanics of secondary injectionfor thrust vector control .  an analysis is made of the interaction of an injectedgas or liquid with a supersonic stream,and the force induced on an adjacent wall is predicted .the study deals only with thefreestream-injectant interaction,. the modifications to theflow introduced by the boundary layerare not considered .  in the case of liquids, it is shownthat the momentum deficit of theinjectant relative to the freestream may play a larger partin producing the side force than thevolume generation by vaporization and reaction .  theanalytical results are compared withthose obtained from experiments in a wind tunnel and in nozzles .
