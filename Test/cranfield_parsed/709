static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at transonic speeds andangles of attack up to 99degree of a reentry glider having foldingwingtip panels ..Aolstad, w.b..Bnasa tm x-610, 1961 ..Wstatic longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at transonic speeds andangles of attack up to 99degree of a reentry glider having foldingwingtip panels .data are presented which were obtained from a transonic wind-tunnelinvestigation of a reentry glider having folding wing-tip panels . thetests were conducted at angles of attack from -4degrees to 99degrees .the reynolds number based on the mean geometric chord of the fixedplanform varied from 2.35 x 10 to 2.99 x 10 .the maximum lift-drag ratio for the model with the folding wing-tippanels fully extended decreased from a maximum value of 7.8 at a machnumber of 0.60 to about 3.4 at mach numbers from 1.03 to 1.20 . themodel with the folding wing panels fully extended was stable for valuesof the lift coefficient from 0 up to at least 0.8 . above this liftcoefficient pitch-up tendencies were observed, followed by an unstable orneutrally stable region which extended up to values of angle of attackof 50degrees or 60degrees . deflecting the folding wing panels betweenducing a significant change in the trim angle of attack or in any of the force or moment coefficients in the angle-of-attack range from 49degreeto 99degree .
