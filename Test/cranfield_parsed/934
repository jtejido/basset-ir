stability of cylindrical and conical shells of circularcross section, with simultaneous action of axial compressionand external normal pressure ..Amushtari,k.m. and sachenkov,a.v..Bnaca tm.1433, 1958..Wstability of cylindrical and conical shells of circularcross section, with simultaneous action of axial compressionand external normal pressure .  we consider in this report thedetermination of the upper limit ofcritical loads in the case of simultaneousaction of a compressive force,uniformly distributed over plane crosssections, and of isotropic externalnormal pressure on cylindrical orconical shells of circular crosssection .  as a starting point we usethe differential equations for neutralequilibrium of conical shells (ref. 1)which have been used for thesolution of the problem of stability of conicalshells under torsion and underaxial compression (ref. 2),. upon solutionof the problem it is possibleto satisfy all boundary conditions, incontrast to the report (ref. 3)where no attention is paid to the fulfillmentof the boundary conditionsand to the report (ref. 4) where only partof the boundary conditions aresatisfied by solution of the problemaccording to galerkin's method .approximate formulas are used for thedetermination of the criticalexternal normal pressure with simultaneousaction of longitudinalcompression .  let us note that the formulassuggested in reference 5 arenot well founded and may lead, in a numberof cases, to a substantialmistake in the magnitude of the critical load .
