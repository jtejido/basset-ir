free-flight measurements of the dynamic longitudinalstability characteristics of a wind tunnel interferencemodel (m=0 .92 to 1. 35) ..Agreenwood,g.h..Brae tn.aero.2798, 1961..Wfree-flight measurements of the dynamic longitudinalstability characteristics of a wind tunnel interferencemodel (m=0 .92 to 1. 35) .  the dynamic longitudinal-stability characteristics of a standardwind tunnel interference model have been investigated in free flightover a mach number range of 0.92 to 1.35 .  measurements of lift-curve slope and manoeuvre margin wereobtained, and are compared with results from transonic-tunnel testsunder low blockage conditions .  the analysis was extended to obtain damping derivatives to allowcomparison to be made with possible future dynamic tests in wind tunnelson the standard shape .
