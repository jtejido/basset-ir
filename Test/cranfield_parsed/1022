note on creep buckling of columns ..A.B.Wnote on creep buckling of columns .  forty-three cylinders of 40-inchlength and 16-inch diameter, madeof 5052-0 aluminum-alloy sheets ofthickness, were subjected to bendingmoments constant along the cylinderand in time in an oven which maintaineda constant temperature of 500 fduring the test .  all the cylindersfailed by buckling .  the time thatelapsed between load application andcollapse was measured .
