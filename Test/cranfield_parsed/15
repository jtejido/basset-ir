on two-dimensional panel flutter ..Afung,y.c..Bj. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 145..Won two-dimensional panel flutter .  theory and experiments of the flutter of a buckled plate arediscussed .  it is shown that an increase in the initial deviationfrom flatness or a static pressure differential across the plateraises the critical value of the /reduced velocity ./  the applicability of the galerkin method to the linearizedproblem of flutter of an unbuckled plate has been questioned byseveral authors .  in this paper the flutter condition wasformulated in the form of an integral equation and solved numericallyby the method of iteration and the method of matrixapproximations, thus avoiding the constraint of assumed modes .  for aplate (with finite bending rigidity) the results confirm thosegiven by the galerkin method .  an approximate analysis of the limiting form and amplitude ofthe flutter motion for a buckled plate is presented .
