subsonic potential flow past a sphere inside a cylindrical duct ..Awilliam l. haberman.Bdavid taylor model basin, carderock, md..Wsubsonic potential flow past a sphere inside a cylindrical duct .the subsonic potential flow of a compressible fluid past a spherein an infinite medium was first determined by rayleigh .  subsequently,caplan and tamada extended the solution to include the fourth powerof the mach number .  to the author's knowledge, no solution forsubsonic flow past a sphere in a finite medium has been published .  itis the purpose of this note to present a solution for subsonicpotential flow past a sphere inside a circular cylindrical duct .
