an experimental investigation of ablating materialat low and high enthalpy potentials ..Arashis,b. and walton,t.e..Bnasa tm.x-263, 1960..Wan experimental investigation of ablating materialat low and high enthalpy potentials .  the ablation performance characteristicsof a number of materialswere derived from tests conducted ina mach number 2.0 ethylene-heatedhigh-temperature air jet having amaximum stagnation enthalpy potentialof approximately 1,200 btu lb .  thetests were conducted with 6-inch-diameter blunt nose shapes .  thesurface of most of the materials aftertesting was generally smooth and theunablated portions of the specimenswere in appearance the same as beforetesting .  in all cases, the backor inside surface of the specimensexhibited no evidence of heating .  an evaluation of the enthalpypotential effect was obtained bycomparison of the present data withprevious tests conducted, on thein a subsonic arc-heated airjet .  the stagnation enthalpy potentialof this facility wasapproximately 7,000 btu lb .  for teflon, theeffective heat of ablation increasedfrom approximately 1,250 btu lb toenthalpy potential was increased from
