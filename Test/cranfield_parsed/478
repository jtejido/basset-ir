tabulation of the blasius function with blowing andsuction ..Aemmons,h.w. and leigh,d.c..Barc cp.1913, 1953..Wtabulation of the blasius function with blowing andsuction .  authors tabulate solutions of f''' + ff'' = 0 for the velocitydistribution in a boundary layer .  for each solution f'(0) = 0,the third boundary condition is the specificationof f(0) .  f(n) and its first three derivatives are tabulated to 5din gaps of 0.1 in n for f(0) = -1.23849, -1.2(0.05) 0.5 (0.1) 1.5,introduction gives method of solution andphysical meaning of boundary conditions, etc .  lock's (amrcussed .
