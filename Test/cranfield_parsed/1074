theoretical and experimental investigation of second-order supersonicwing-body interference ..Alandahl, m., drougge, g. and beane, b.j..Bj. aero. sc. v. 27, september 1960. pp 694-702 ..Wtheoretical and experimental investigation of second-order supersonicwing-body interference .approximate second-order solutions for the supersonic flow aroundwing-body combinations are calculated, using two different theoretical modelssmall and the wing sweep small in comparison with that of the mach coneare considered . the analysis is restricted to such high mach numbersthat m-2 1, and an approximate formula common to the two models is thenfound for the second-order interference term . this formula can also beused to correct experimental pressure distributions for the effect ofnonuniformities in the wind-tunnel flow .in order to test the theory, wind-tunnel experiments on non-liftingcone-cylinder bodies in combination with wings of simple shapes wereperformed . pressure distributions were measured at m 3 and m 4, botharound the bodies and on the wings separately, as well as incombination, and it was found that the second-order interference waspredicted reasonably well by the simplified theory .
