interferometric studies of supersonic flows about truncatedcones ..Agiese,j.h. and bergdolt,v.e..Bj.app.phys. 24, 1953, 1389..Winterferometric studies of supersonic flows about truncatedcones .  fringe shifts on interferograms of flows at m=2.45about variously truncated 15 (half-angle) conecylinders in free flight in a pressurized range have beenexamined for similarity of the flow fields, occurrence ofscale effects, and convergence to conical flow .  it wasfound that flows over similar objects with equal tipreynolds numbers were similar and that convergenceto conical flow occurred before the disturbance at thetip had been reflected the second time alongcharacteristics to the body .  density distributions have beendetermined, and a number of comparisons havebeen made with theoretical predictions .
