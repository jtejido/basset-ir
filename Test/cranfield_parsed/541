similitude of hypersonic flows over slender bodiesin non-equilibrium dissociated gases ..Ainger,g.r..Ba.i.a.a. j. 1963, 46..Wsimilitude of hypersonic flows over slender bodiesin non-equilibrium dissociated gases .  this paper is concerned with the similitude lawsgoverning inviscid, nonequilibrium gas flowsaround blunt or sharp-nosed slender bodies atzero angle of attack, based on the hypersonicsmall disturbance flow theory .  some relatedfeatures of the interaction between the effects ofnose bluntness and nonequilibrium dissociationand vibration and the influence of adissociated freestream are also discussed .  thehypersonic equivalence principle and the relatedsimilitude for affinely related bodies are setforth for nonequilibrium flows in either diatomicgases or a gas mixture such as air .  for a familyof diatomic gases, as opposed to a given gassuch as air, a generalized ambient gas statescaling condition is obtained, whereby theambient density and temperature need not besimulated .  a detailed discussion is given ofblunted cylinders and slabs or sharp-nosedcones and wedges, including examplenonequilibrium flow field correlations of numericalsolutions available in the literature .  low densitynonequilibrium flows with a negligible shocklayer atom recombination rate are alsoexamined ,. as expected, a less restrictive smalldisturbance similitude law is obtained in thiscase .
