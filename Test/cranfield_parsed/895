the airforces on the low aspect ratio rectangular wingoscillating in sonic flow ..Adavies,d.e..Brae tn. struct.311, 1962..Wthe airforces on the low aspect ratio rectangular wingoscillating in sonic flow .  approximate expressions for thegeneralised airforces acting on arectangular wing of low aspect ratiooscillating harmonically in sonic flowat low frequencies are derived in thispaper .  the modes of oscillationconsidered are rigid modes and a smallselection of flexible modes .  resultsare presented as the first few terms ofinfinite expansions .  a brief description of the modesof oscillation and of the generalisedairforces is given towards the end ofthe paper so that the results may beused without the main text of the paperhaving to be read .
