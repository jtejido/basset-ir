an approximate method for determining the displacement effects andviscous drag of laminar boundary layers in two-dimensional hypersonicflow ..Abertram, m.h..Bnaca tn 2773, 1952 ..Wan approximate method for determining the displacement effects andviscous drag of laminar boundary layers in two-dimensional hypersonicflow .a simplified approximate theory is presented by means of which thelaminar boundary layer over an insulated two-dimensional surface may becalculated, a linear velocity profile being assumed, and an estimatemade of its effect in changing the pressure distribution over theprofile upon which the boundary layer is formed . skin friction is alsodetermined . comparisons of results from this theory are made withexperimental results at a mach number of 6.86 and a reynolds number of
