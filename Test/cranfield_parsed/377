a turbulent analog of the stewartson-illingworth transformation ..Aculick,f.e. and hill,j..Bj. ae. scs. 25, 1958..Wa turbulent analog of the stewartson-illingworth transformation .  the stewartson-illingworth transformation is applied to theintegral momentum equation for compressible boundary-layerflow, leaving the x-coordinate transformation unspecified,however .  it is shown that the transformed equation is the integralmomentum equation for incompressible flow if (a) the effect ofcompressibility on the boundary-layer shape parameter h can berepresented byand (b) the x-coordinate transformation is chosen to be suitablyrelated to the ratio of skin-friction coefficients in compressibleand incompressible flows .  experimental evidence is presented which shows thatcondition (a) is satisfied for turbulent boundary layers up to m = 5 .an x-transformation is chosen according to (b) and an equation ispresented which gives the turbulent boundary-layer growth incompressible flow in terms of a simple quadrature .  thepredictions of this equation are then compared with somemeasurements on wind-tunnel nozzles .
