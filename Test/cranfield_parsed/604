the 7 in. x 7 in. hypersonic wind tunnel at r.a.e., farnboroughpart iii - calibration of the flow in the working section ..Aj. f. w. crane.B.Wthe 7 in. x 7 in. hypersonic wind tunnel at r.a.e., farnboroughpart iii - calibration of the flow in the working section .the fused silica nozzle to give m=7 in the 7 in. x 7 in. hypersonicwind tunnel produces a flow field with an average mach number of 6.85along the centreline of the working section .  the mach number graduallydecreases towards the boundary layer, and over a core of approximatelymach number .the nozzle heats up during a run but this has little effect on themach number distribution .  at one station the mach number was one-thirdper cent greater for a run of 1 minute than for a run of 10 seconds .the temperature field in the inviscid flow has an average variation ofin temperature with time throughout a run .
