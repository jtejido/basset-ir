the gyroscopic effect of a rigid rotating propelleron engine and wing vibration modes ..Ascanlan,r.h. and truman,j.c..Bj. ae. scs. 17, 1950, 653..Wthe gyroscopic effect of a rigid rotating propelleron engine and wing vibration modes .  in many wing vibration analyses it is found necessary to takeinto account the effect of flexibly mounted engines .  hence,it is reasonable to ask what vibratory gyroscopic effect thisflexibility may give rise to when propellers are whirling .  an enginemount may be thought of as a horizontal beam cantileveredfrom the wing, having both horizontal and vertical flexibility .if this beam were infinitely rigid horizontally, then, when itvibrated, the gyroscopic moments induced in the propeller dueto the resultant pitching motion of its axis would not producepropeller axis yaw .  however, engine-mount lateral stiffnesstical stiffness, so that gyroscopic effects will play a role as thepropeller axis undergoes pitching vibrations at the tip of thecantilever engine mount .  the purpose of this paper is toinvestigate this role under the assumption that the propeller itselfis a rigid disc .  the paper is divided into four parts .  part (1) deals brieflywith classical gyroscope theory .  part (2) presents enginevibration mode studies-experimental photographic techniques on amodel gyroscope mounted at the ends of two different cantileverbeams .  part (3) presents the theory of the coupled motion ofan elastic wing upon which a gyroscope is mounted to simulatean engine-propeller system on an airplane .  part (4) consistsof an example of the theory of part (3), in which, by takingwhat are thought to be reasonable parameters, results areobtained showing how the whirling of a rigid propeller maymaterially affect wing normal mode shapes and frequencies .
