a unified theory of creep buckling under normal loads ..Astowell,e.z. and thein wah..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 658..Wa unified theory of creep buckling under normal loads .  a general theory of creep buckling, with the initialimperfection as a parameter, is developed for the case of normal loading .a hyperbolic-sine law is used to describe the process of creep .  thetheory is believed to be applicable to, among other structures,columns, tubes, and possibly conical shells .  the wall of thestructure is idealized as a sandwich in order to simplify theintegration of the equations .  experimental data on columns and tubes, from two differentsources, are compared with the predictions of the theory .
