on the thrust hypothesis for the jet flap includingjet-mixing effects ..Ayen,k.t..Bj. ae. scs. 1960, 607..Won the thrust hypothesis for the jet flap includingjet-mixing effects .  this paper is concerned with the thrust generated by a jetflap .  it is shown that a /linear/ thrust hypothesis can beobtained, provided linearized potential flow is assumed .  in fact,the linearized problem of a jet-flap system is found to be thelinear combination of a lift problem and a thrust problem .  thelift problem gives all the lift generated, but it is of interest to notethat the thrust problem would yield all the thrust developed bythe jet flap within the limitation of the linearized theory .  the mixing of the jet flap with the surrounding fluid is analyzedby the momentum-integral method .  the analysis substantiatesstratford's suggestion for obtaining an increase of thrust bycausing the jet to mix with the main stream in a region of highsuction .  finally, some approximate formulas, relating the thrustand the jet angle, are derived .  the drag of the airfoil section andother viscous effects are, however, not considered .
