combustion in the boundary layer on a porous surface ..Aeschenroeder,a.q..Bj. ae. scs. 1960, 901..Wcombustion in the boundary layer on a porous surface .  the position of the diffusion flame in a boundary layer withuniform mixture injection from a porous wall parallel to a uniformair stream is determined under the conditions of laminar, steadyflow with zero streamwise pressure gradient .  under theassumption of fast forward reaction rate, solutions of the boundarylayer forms of the conservation laws of acrothermochemistry areobtained leading to a formula for the downstream velocity atthe flame in terms of composition and flow variables .  therates of change of conditions at the wall in the streamwisedirection are assumed to be relatively small .  methods oftreating complex reaction systems are described, and generalizedform of the reynolds analogy is developed .
