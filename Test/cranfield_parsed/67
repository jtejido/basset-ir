dynamic stability of vehicles traversing ascendingor descending paths through the atmosphere ..Atobak and allen..Bnaca tn.4275, 1958..Wdynamic stability of vehicles traversing ascendingor descending paths through the atmosphere .  an analysis is given of the oscillatory motions of vehicles whichtraverse ascending and descending paths through the atmosphere at highspeed .  the specific case of a skip path is examined in detail, andthis leads to a form of solution for the oscillatory motion which shouldrecur over any trajectory .  the distinguishing feature of this form isthe appearance of the bessel rather than the trigonometric function asthe characteristic mode of oscillation .
