the law of the wake in the turbulent boundary layer ..Acoles,d..Bj. fluid mech. 1, 1956,191..Wthe law of the wake in the turbulent boundary layer .  after an extensive survey of mean-velocity profile measurementsin various two-dimensional incompressible turbulentboundary-layer flows, it is proposed to represent the profile by a linearcombination of two universal functions .  one is the well-knownlaw of the wall .  the other, called the law of the wake, ischaracterized by the profile at a point of separation or reattachment .these functions are considered to be established empirically, bya study of the mean-velocity profile, without reference to anyhypothetical mechanism of turbulence .  using the resultingcomplete analytic representation for the mean-velocity field,the shearing-stress field for several flows is computed from theboundary-layer equations and compared with experimental data .  the development of a turbulent boundary layer is ultimatelyinterpreted in terms of an equivalent wake profile, which supposedlyrepresents the large-eddy structure and is a consequence of theconstraint provided by inertia .  this equivalent wake profile ismodified by the presence of a wall, at which a further constraint isprovided by viscosity .  the wall constraint, although it penetratesthe entire boundary layer, is manifested chiefly in the sublayer flowand in the logarithmic profile near the wall .  finally, it is suggested that yawed or three-dimensional flowsmay be usefully represented by the same two universal functions,considered as vector rather than scalar quantities .  if the wallcomponent is defined to be in the direction of the surface shearingstress, then the wake component, at least in the few cases studied,is found to be very nearly parallel to the gradient of the pressure .
