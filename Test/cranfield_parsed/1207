supersonic airfoil performance with small heat addition ..Amager,a..Bj.ae.scs. 1959, 99..Wsupersonic airfoil performance with small heat addition .  an analytical method is presented which permits a very rapidevaluation of the acrodynamic effects arising from the additionof small amounts of heat near supersonic two-dimensionalairfoils .  this method applies to shockless inviscid flow without heatconduction .  also, the mechanism by which the sesired heataddition is achieved is not considered .  it is shown that even small amounts of heat generate asubstantial pressure rise and thus cause appreciable changes in theacrodynamic coefficients .  the results of this analysis comparefavorably with those obtained by a more accurate, but also moretedious, graphical method of characteristics .  two possible modes of application to an airplane design areconsidered from the energy requirements standpoint .  in thisconnection, it is shown that the decrease of the required wingarea resulting from heat addition may, in some cases, lead tosavings in the rate of the fuel consumption .  in general, however,one should not expect any substantial reduction in energyrequirements resulting from the application of the wing heataddition .
