response of plates to a decaying and convecting randonpressure field ..Adyer,i..Bj.acous.s.am. 31, 1959, 922..Wresponse of plates to a decaying and convecting randonpressure field .  following the methods of lyon, an analysis of thevibratory response of a plate to a random pressurefield is given .  the pressure correlation of the randomfield is assumed to have a scale small compared tothe plate size, to decay exponentially, and to convectwith constant speed over the plate .  two cases areconsidered, one in which the convection speed is muchless than the speed of free flexural waves in the plate,the other in which the convection speed is the sameorder as the flexural wave speed .  the mean square platedisplacement is shown to be relatively independentof convection for speeds much less than the flexuralwave speed, and to increase significantly for speeds inthe order of the flexural wave speed .  it is shown thatdamping is usually, but not always, an effective meansof vibration reduction .  in the case of convectionspeeds much smaller than the flexural speed, the use ofhysteretic damping for reduction of the displacementresponse is shown to be limited by the decay of theassumed random pressure field .
