the smallest height of roughness capable of affecting boundary-layertransition ..Asmith, a.m.o. and clutter, d.w..Bj. aero. sc. april, 1959. p.229-245, 256 ..Wthe smallest height of roughness capable of affecting boundary-layertransition .an investigation was made to determine the smallest size of isolatedroughness that will affect transition in a laminar-boundary layer .critical heights for three types of roughness were found in a low-speedwind tunnel . the types were /1/ two-dimensional spanwise wires, /2/three-dimensional discs, and /3/ a sandpaper type . in addition to typeof roughness, test variables included the location of roughness,pressure distribution, degree of tunnel turbulence, and length of naturallaminar flow .the most satisfactory correlation parameter was found to be theroughness reynolds number, based on the height of roughness and flowproperties at this height . the value of this critical reynolds number wasfound to be substantially independent of all test variables except theshape of roughness . this parameter also correlates well other published data on critical roughness in low-speed flow . the value of theroughness reynolds number necessary to move transition forward to theroughness itself was also determined for the three types of roughness and was found to be approximately constant for a given type of roughness .an investigation of the limited amount of available data on criticalroughness in supersonic flow indicates that the effects of roughness may still be correlated by the roughness reynolds number . the value ofthis reynolds number depends primarily on the mach number at the top ofthe roughness . when this mach number is greater than 1.0, the roughness reynolds number based on conditions behind a shock is probably thecharacteristic parameter .
