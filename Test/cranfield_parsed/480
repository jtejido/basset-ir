adiabatic wall temperature due to mass transfer cooling with acombustible gas ..Ad. b. spalding.Bimperial college, london, england.Wadiabatic wall temperature due to mass transfer cooling with acombustible gas .a recent technical note by sutton (1), with the above title, discussesthe influence of the burning of a transpiration coolant on the quantityof coolant necessary to maintain a given wall temperature .  the presentnote discusses the same problem in a way which has been found usefulin calculating the burning rates of solid and liquid fuels (2) .consider the transpiration cooling of a porous surface in a gas stream .then a simple modification of the general mass .
