stagnation point viscous hypersonic flow ..Astoddard,f.j..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962, 1138..Wstagnation point viscous hypersonic flow .several methods have been developed for computing thehypersonic, low reynolds number flow in the stagnationregion of a blunt body .  in general, these methods involvecomplicated numerical solutions .  simultaneous iterations on severalparameters are usually required in view of the boundary-valuenature of the problem .  the purpose of this note is to present an approximateclosed-form solution to axisymmetric stagnation point hypersonic flowin the viscous layer regime .
