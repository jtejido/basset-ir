stagnation region in rarefied high mach number flow ..Acheng,h.k. and chang,a.l..Ba.i.a.a. j. 1963, 231..Wstagnation region in rarefied high mach number flow .  paper describes results of numerical solution of the viscousshock-layer equations for axisymmetric stagnation region, usingthe viscosity-temperature law with w=0.65, pr=0.71 andy=1.25 .  purpose is to establish applicability of the simpleapproximation of w=1 (obtained earlier) to air at low reynoldsnumbers and low ratios of wall temperature to stagnationtemperature .  using a reference temperature (closely equal toeckert's) to interpret the linear results, excellent agreement is found,in the limit of, over a wide range of reynolds numbers,covering fully merged shock layers as well as boundary layerswith and without vorticity interaction .  agreement with recentexperiments of ferri et al is as good as to be expected fromshock-layer approximation .  paper provides valuable extension of theapplicability of the reference temperature concept .
