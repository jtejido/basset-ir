a study of the thermal fatigue behaviour of metals . the effect of test conditions on nickel-base hightemperature alloys ..Aglenny,e. and taylor,t.a..Bj.inst.metals, 88, 1960, 449..Wa study of the thermal fatigue behaviour of metals . the effect of test conditions on nickel-base hightemperature alloys .an attempt has been made to identify the significant factors governingthe thermal-fatigue behaviour of nickel-base high-temperature alloys,mainly by using a laboratory technique with hot and cold fluidized bedsas the heating and cooling media .  a succession of heating shocks isgenerally more damaging than a succession of cooling shocks between thesame temperature limits .  the duration of the heating shock and theupper temperature of the cycle are dominant factors .  thethermal-fatigue cracks are initiated at the surface and are intercrystalline inorigin and propagation .  surface oxidation, which is intergranular innature for nickel-base alloys, has a significant effect onthermal-fatigue life .
