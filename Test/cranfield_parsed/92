the analysis of redundant structures by the use ofhigh-speed digital computers ..Achrichlow,w.j. and haggenmacher,g.w..Bj. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 595..Wthe analysis of redundant structures by the use ofhigh-speed digital computers .  large-scale redundant structure analyses are currentlyfeasible by the use of modern high-speed digital computers .this capability opportunely meets the urgent need to solvecomplex problems which otherwise would be hopelessly beyondthe capacity of the hand desk computer .  however, the difficultieshave now shifted from tedious hand computations to the problemsof adequately representing the structure by a model andof the peculiarities of irregular geometrical configurations .  a wide scope of problem types can be handled by a generalizedprogram approach .  matrix formulation is used for the organizationof input data and for handling data transfer in the largecomplex of subroutines, including the formation of equilibriumand continuity conditions to the final loads and deflections .simultaneous treatment of thermal expansions and plasticityis included .  the use of minimum-size redundant systems is emphasized,starting from the philosophy of cutting members to provide astatically determinate structure .  improved numerical accuracyand problem size capacity is gained for a given computer .examples are discussed ranging from simple plane-load diffusionproblems to pressurized fuselage cutouts and complexwing-fuselage-shell intersection-type problems .
