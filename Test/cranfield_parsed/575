atomic recombination in a hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle ..Abray, k.n.c..Bj. fluid mech. v.6 part 1, 1-32. july, 1959 ..Watomic recombination in a hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle .the flow of an ideal dissociating gas through a nearly conical nozzle is considered . the equations of one-dimensional motion are solvednumerically assuming a simple rate equation together with a number ofdifferent values for the rate constant . these calculations suggest thatdeviations from chemical equilibrium will occur in the nozzle if therate constant lies within a very wide range of values, and that, oncesuch a deviation has begun, the gas will very rapidly 'freeze' . thedissociation fraction will then remain almost constant if the flow isexpanded further, or even if it passes through a constant area section . an approximate method of solution, making use of this property ofsudden 'freezing' of the flow, has been developed and applied to theproblem of estimating the deviations from equilibrium under a wide range of conditions . if all the assumptions made in this paper are accepted,then lack of chemical equilibrium may be expected in the workingsections of hypersonic wind tunnels and shock tubes . the shape of anoptimum nozzle is derived in order to minimize this departure fromequilibrium .it is shown that, while the test section conditions are greatly affected by 'freezing', the flow behind a normal shock wave is only changedslightly . the heat transfer rate and drag of a blunt body are estimated to be reduced by only about 25 per cent even if complete freezingoccurs . however, the shock wave shape is shown to be rather moresensitive to departures from equilibrium .
