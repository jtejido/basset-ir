approximate design of sharp-cornered supersonic nozzles ..Am. a. rahman.Bnack and sunderland consulting mech. and elec. engineers.Wapproximate design of sharp-cornered supersonic nozzles .a modified parabolic curve appears to be in close proximity to thatobtained by either the method of characteristics or the wave method .thus an attempt has been made to use analytic geometry to determineapproximately the contour of a two-dimensional, sharp-corneredsupersonic nozzle in a very short time .
