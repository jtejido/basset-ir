on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells ..A.B.Won transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells .it is shown that a perfectly straight bar, subjectedto a state of uniform shear stress, willbuckle, in a manner similar to a column undercompression, if the shear stress exceedsa certain critical value .  the buckling equationsare obtained by the newtonianapproach and also by the application of the principleof minimum potential energy .  inorder to provide additional insight into this bucklingmechanism, a simple model isintroduced and analyzed .
