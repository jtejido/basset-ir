factors affecting lift-drag ratios at mach numbersfrom 5 to 20 ..Agoebel,t.p. martin,j.j. and boyd,j.a..Baiaa jnl. 1963, 640..Wfactors affecting lift-drag ratios at mach numbersfrom 5 to 20 .  yawed-cone working charts and an engineeringmethod are presented and used to calculatelift-drag ratios of flat-top conical wing-bodyarrangements at mach numbers from 5 to 20 .viscous interaction effects are considered, butbluntness effects are neglected .  correlationsof wind-tunnel data in the rangeshow that boundary layerdisplacement corrections to surface pressure and skinfriction are required to calculate lift-drag ratiosby this method wheneveris greater than 0.2 .  is the freestream machnumber and is the freestream reynoldsnumber based on body length .  double- andsingle-type shock patterns, transition from onepattern to the other, and the variation of inner-shockposition with angle of attack are described .lift-drag ratios are calculated at selected flightdesign points for flat-top, conical bodyarrangements with triangular and hyperbolic wingplanforms .  the hyperbolic wing arrangementoffers a potential l d benefit at mach 5 butnot at mach 10 or above .
