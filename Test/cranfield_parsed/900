some measurements in the vortex flow generated by asharp leading edge having 65 sweep ..Alambourne,n.c. and bryer,d.w..Barc cp.477, 1959..Wsome measurements in the vortex flow generated by asharp leading edge having 65 sweep .  the report is concerned with the vortex flow which ariseswhen separation occurs at a highly swept leading edge .  measurementswere made in the flow over flat plates at 15 incidence each havinga sharp leading edge of 65 sweep .  the pressure and velocitydistributions both along the axis of the vortex and for onecross section of the flow are presented together with a preliminarydiscussion of their significance .
