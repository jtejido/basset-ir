on the mixing of two parallel streams ..Ating,lu..Bj.math.phys. 38, 1959, 153..Won the mixing of two parallel streams .  using the techniques of boundary-layer theory, the proper thirdboundary condition for the mixing of two parallel streams isderived from the compatibility condition of the higher orderapproximation .  it is shown that the commonly adopted third boundarycondition of balancing of transverse momentum is correct only forthe mixing problem of two semi-infinite incompressible streams .for the fulfillment of the proper third boundary condition, thepossibility of introducing the similar solution of blasius type isexamined for various cases .
