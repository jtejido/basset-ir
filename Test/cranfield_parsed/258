the effect of turbulence on slider bearing lubrication ..Achou,y.t. and saibei,e..Bj.app.mech. 25, 1959, 122..Wthe effect of turbulence on slider bearing lubrication .based on prandtl's mixing-length mechanism, the pressureequation for turbulent flow inslider-bearing lubrication is derived .  an analyticalsolution is given and compared withthe one for laminar flow .  it is found that the turbulenteffect increases the pressure andconsequently, the load-carrying capacity .  however, thepower loss also increases .
