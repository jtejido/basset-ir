numerical solution of the boundary layer equationswithout similarity assumptions ..Akramer,r.f. and lieberstein,h..Bj. ae. scs. 26, 1959, 508..Wnumerical solution of the boundary layer equationswithout similarity assumptions .  the crocco transformation combined with a manglertransformation is used to carry the boundary-layer problem for axiallysymmetric blunt bodies into a form suitable for direct numericalcomputation without introduction of similarity assumptions .conditions which in the original problem appear at infinity noware brought to a finite straight line, and the body is transformedto a parallel line .  data can be generated on the stagnation linethe equations are a parabolic system of two second-orderequations, the boundary-value problem is analogous to the slabproblem for the heat equation .  an implicit difference equation isused to reduce stability difficulties .  special techniques informing the difference equation result in a linear system of algebraicequations to be solved on any given line of integration, and thesesolutions are computed from recursion relations generated byback substitution .  for bluntnosed bodies with approach flowmach numbers greater than 8 (approximately), largetemperature gradients occur across a thin boundary layer of dissociatedgas, and it is necessary to use real-gas effects, approximated hereby certain fits to the gas tables .  a case is computed, however,for a lower mach number approach flow using perfect-gas theoryto provide a standard against which similarity solutions may betested .
