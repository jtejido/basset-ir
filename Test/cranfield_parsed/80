effect of distributed three-dimensional roughness andsurface cooling on boundary layer transition and lateralspread of turbulence at supersonic speeds ..Abraslow,a.l..Bnasa tn.d53, 1959..Weffect of distributed three-dimensional roughness andsurface cooling on boundary layer transition and lateralspread of turbulence at supersonic speeds .  an investigation was made in the langley 4 by 4-foot supersonicpressure tunnel at mach numbers of 1.61 and 2.01 to determine (1) theeffect of distributed roughness on boundary-layer transition with themodel surface at adiabatic wall temperature and cooled and (2) theeffect of surface cooling on the lateral spread of turbulence .  bothdistributed granular-type and single spherical roughness particles wereused, and transition of the boundary layer was determined by hot-wireanemometers .  the transition-triggering mechanism of thethree-dimensional roughness at supersonic speeds appeared to be the same asthat previously observed at subsonic speeds .  in fact, the criticalvalue of the roughness reynolds number parameter (that is,the value at which turbulent spots are initiated by the roughness) wasfound to be approximately the same at supersonic and subsonic speedswhen complete local conditions at the top of the roughness, includingdensity and viscosity, were considered in the formulation of theroughness reynolds number .  for three-dimensional roughness at a reynoldsnumber less than its critical value, the roughness introduced nodisturbances of sufficient magnitude to influence transition .  surfacecooling, although providing a theoretical increase in stability to smalldisturbances, did not increase to any important extent the value of thecritical roughness reynolds number for three-dimensional roughnessparticles .  cooling, therefore, because of its effect on theboundary-layer thickness, density, and viscosity actually promoted transition dueto existing three-dimensional surface roughness for given mach andreynolds numbers .  the measured lateral spread of turbulence in theboundary layer appeared to be unaffected by the increased laminarstability derived from the surface cooling .
