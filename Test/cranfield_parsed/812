investigation of two bluff shapes in axial free flightover a mach number range from 0. 35 to 2. 15 ..Acoltrane,l.c..Bnaca rm l58a16, 1958..Winvestigation of two bluff shapes in axial free flightover a mach number range from 0. 35 to 2. 15 .  a fineness-ratio-2.71 right circular cylinder and a fineness-ratio-been tested in free flight over a mach number range of 0.35 to 2.15 anda reynolds number range of 1 x 10 to 12 x 10 .  time histories, crossplots of force coefficients, rolling velocity, and longitudinal-forcecoefficient are presented for both cylinders .  in addition, cross plotsof moment coefficients and plots of the normal-force curve slope andthe aerodynamic center are presented for the fineness-ratio-2.71cylinder .  the average aerodynamic center of the right circularcylinder moved rearward with decreasing speeds until at the subsonicmach numbers it remained approximately constant and comparisons of thedrag data of this test with wind tunnel and other free-flight data showgood agreement .  an appreciable decrease in drag was observed when thedata of the present test of the rounded nose cylinder were compared withdata of a right circular cylinder of a similar configuration .
