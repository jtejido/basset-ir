unsteady aerodynamic forces on a slender body of revolutionin supersonic flow ..Abond,r. and packard,b.b..Bnasa tn.d859, 1961..Wunsteady aerodynamic forces on a slender body of revolutionin supersonic flow .  linearized slender-body theoryis applied to the computation ofaerodynamic forces on an oscillating,or deforming, body in supersonicflow .  the undeformed body is a bodyof revolution and the deformed bodyis represented by movement of a linethrough the centers of the crosssections which are assumed to remaincircular .  the time dependence isbased on sinusoidal motion .  for a body of vanishing thicknessthe slender-body theory yieldsthe apparent mass approximation as itis obtained for incompressiblecrossflow around a cylinder .  both linearized slender-body theoryand the apparent massapproximation are used to calculate thepitching-moment coefficients on a rigidslender body with a parabolic arc nosecone, and these coefficients arecompared with some experimental results .
