on combined free and forced convection laminar magnetohydrodynamicflow and heat transfer in channels with transversemagnetic field ..Amori,y..Bint. devel. in heat transfer,1961..Won combined free and forced convection laminar magnetohydrodynamicflow and heat transfer in channels with transversemagnetic field .  combined free and forced convective heattransfer in vertical channels has been studied by manyresearchers .  due to the need for engineering designinformation there have been many papers concerningcases of fully developed flow with varying walltemperature .  forced flows in a channel of electricallyconducting fluid with a transverse magnetic fieldhave been studied and the large effects of a magneticfield on the flow pattern have been established .  flows of combined free and forced convection inelectrically conducting fluids in vertical channelswith a transverse magnetic field are expected toattract attention in future engineering applications, forexample, in a magneto-hydrodynamic generator or inplasma studies .  however, except for a report bygershuni and zhukhovitskii (1) concerning aparticular case, no general study has been published .  this paper is a general treatment of fullydeveloped, free and forced convective, laminar,magneto-hydrodynamic flow in a vertical channel with atransverse magnetic field .  it includes combined free andforced convective flows in channels without amagnetic field reported by ostrach (2), tao (3), etc. asspecial cases .  hartmann flow (4) is included in theother limit .
