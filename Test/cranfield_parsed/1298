theory of radiation from luminous shock waves in nitrogen ..Ahammerling,p., teare,j.d. and kivel,b..Bphys. fluids, 1959, 2, 422..Wtheory of radiation from luminous shock waves in nitrogen .  the physical properties behind a normal shock innitrogen are calculated as a function of time .these include the variation of temperature, composition,ionization, and the intensity of radiationfrom the n first negative band system .  this calculationincorporates a rate equation for thedissociation of nitrogen, the conservation laws, an equationdescribing vibrational relaxation, and amethod of coupling the vibrational relaxation with thedissociation rate .  the n radiation iscomputed assuming excitation of the radiating state bycollision with vibrationally excited nitrogenmolecules .  a particular case is considered for whichexperimental data are available, and regionssensitive to particular rates are indicated .
