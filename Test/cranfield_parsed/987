a general theory of three dimensional flow in subsonic and supersonicturbo-machines of axial-radial-and mixed-flow types ..Awu, c..Bnaca tn 2604, 1952 ..Wa general theory of three dimensional flow in subsonic and supersonicturbo-machines of axial-radial-and mixed-flow types .a general theory of steady three-dimensional flow of a nonviscous fluidin subsonic and supersonic turbomachines having arbitrary hub and casing shapes and a finite number of blades is presented . the solution of the three-dimensional direct and inverse problem is obtained byinvestigating an appropriate combination of flows on relative stream surfaceswhose intersections with a z-plane either upstream of or somewhereinside the blade row form a circular arc or a radial line . the equationsobtained to describe the fluid flow on these stream surfaces showclearly the several approximations involved in ordinary two-dimensionaltreatments . they also lead to a solution of the three-dimensionalproblem in a mathematically two-dimensional manner through iteration .the equation of continuity is combined with the equation of motion ineither the tangential or the radial direction through the use of astream function defined on the surface, and the resulting equation ischosen as the principal equation for such flows . the character of thisequation depends on the relative magnitude of the local velocity ofsound and a certain combination of velocity components of the fluid . ageneral method to solve this equation by both hand and high-speeddigital machine computations when the equation is elliptic or hyperbolic is described . the theory is applicable to both irrotational androtational absolute flow at the inlet of the blade row and at both designand off-design operations .
