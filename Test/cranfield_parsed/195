correlation of theoretical and photo-thermoelasticresults on thermal stresses in idealized wing structure ..Atramposch,h. and gerard,g..Bj.app.mech. 27, 1960..Wcorrelation of theoretical and photo-thermoelasticresults on thermal stresses in idealized wing structure .after a rather complete exploratory programdescribed in previous papers, thephoto-thermoelastic method was applied to theexperimental evaluation of the thermal-stresstheories .  the new technique was correlatedwith several theories which analyzed thetransient thermal stresses in idealized wingstructures of high-speed aircraft .  varioustheories were investigated which representedthe same idealized wing models anddiffered from each other only in the simplifyingassumptions regarding the temperaturedistributions in skin and webs .  the theorieswere evaluated by duplicating the boundaryand initial conditions on plastic models andthen by correlating the theories with theobserved fringe orders in nondimensional form .a significant general conclusion wasreached after correlating the available theoriesand experimental results .  owing tosimplifying assumptions concerning the thermalbehavior in the flanges, thermalstresses predicted by the available theories are allhigher than the experimentalobservation .  in some cases the discrepancy is as great as 30 per cent .
