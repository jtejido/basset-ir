boundary layer behind shock or thin expansion wavemoving into stationary fluid ..Amirels,h..Bnaca tn.3712, 1956..Wboundary layer behind shock or thin expansion wavemoving into stationary fluid .  the boundary layer behind a shock or thin expansion wave advancinginto a stationary fluid has been determined .  laminar and turbulentboundary layers were considered .  the wall surface temperature behindthe wave was also investigated .  the assumption of a thin expansionwave is valid for weak expansions but becomes progressively lessaccurate for strong expansion waves .  the laminar-boundary-layer problem was solved by numericalintegration except for the weak wave case,which can be solved analytically .integral (karman-pohlhausen type)solutions were also obtained to providea guide for determining expressionswhich accurately represent thenumerical data .  analytical expressionsfor various boundary-layer parametersare presented which agree with thenumerical integrations within 1 percent .  the turbulent-boundary-layer problem was solved using integralmethods similar to those employed for thesolution of turbulent compressibleflow over a semi-infinite flat plate .the fluid velocity, relative tothe wall, was assumed to have aseventh-power profile .  the blasiusequation, relating turbulent skin frictionand boundary-layer thickness, wasutilized in a form which accounted for compressibility .  consideration of the heat transfer to the wall permitted the wallsurface temperature, behind the wave,to be determined .  the wallthickness was assumed to be greater than thewall thermal-boundary-layerthickness .  it was found that the walltemperature was uniform (as afunction of distance behind the wave)for the laminar-boundary-layer casebut varied with distance for the turbulent-boundary-layer case .
