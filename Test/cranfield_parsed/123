the downstream influence of mass transfer at the noseof a slender cone ..Acresci,r.j. and libby,p.a..Bj.aer.scs. 29, 1962, 815..Wthe downstream influence of mass transfer at the noseof a slender cone .  the influence of localized mass transfer at the nose of a slendercone under hypersonic flow conditions has been studied byexperimental and theoretical means .  two gaseous coolants, nitrogenand helium, are injected through a porous plug subtending ahalf angle of 30 .  the effect of the mass transfer on the shockshape, pressure distribution, heat transfer, and transition areinvestigated .  the experimental work involved tests in themach-number-8.0 tunnel at pibal .  the theoretical analysis involveda study of the effect of mass transfer on the shock stand-offdistance and leads to an inviscid-flow parameter permitting theexperimentally determined shock shape and pressure distributionto be extrapolated to other than test conditions and to othercoolant gases .  there is obtained the maximum value of thisparameter resulting in no significant alteration of the pressuredistribution on the cone and thus defining the flows in whichboundary-layer-type similarity applies .  significant reductions in heat transfer are obtained withinjection .  indeed, with small amounts of helium injection thepeak heating is found to occur downstream on the cone and to bean order of magnitude less than would occur at the stagnationpoint without mass transfer .  with nitrogen early transition isfound to occur, so that local heating rates are actually increasedover those prevailing at the same reynolds number withoutinjection .
