general theory of large deflections of thin shellswith special applications to conical shells ..Adill,e.h..Bnasa tn.d826, 1961..Wgeneral theory of large deflections of thin shellswith special applications to conical shells .  a general theory is developed for the case of large deflectionsbut with rotations of the elements negligible compared to unity .  thederivation is carried out in tensor form and therefore any coordinatesystem on the surface of the shell can be used .  the effect of initialimperfections is included .  it is shown that for shells of negligiblegaussian curvature (shallow shells and developable surfaces), theproblem can be reduced to the solution of two fourth-order partialdifferential equations in a stress function and the deflection normal to theshell .  for shells forming a surface of revolution the results areindicated in terms of the equation of the generating curve .  thedifferential equations for the conical shell are then listed .
