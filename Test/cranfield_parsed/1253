hypersonic viscous flow near the stagnation point inthe presence of magnetic field ..Awu,ching-sheng..Bj. ae. scs. 1960, 882..Whypersonic viscous flow near the stagnation point inthe presence of magnetic field .  the present study investigates the hypersonic viscous flowpast blunt-nosed bodies with hydromagnetic interaction .local-similarity solutions of flow field and temperature distribution arenear the stagnation-point region .  the discussions may begrouped into two parts ..  the two-dimensional problem (circularcylinder) and axisymmetric problem (sphere) .  numerical computations have been carried out for the sphereproblem for the /viscous-layer regime,/ with various magneticfield strengths and electrical conductivities .
