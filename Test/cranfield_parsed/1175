stresses from local loadings in cylindrical pressurevessels ..Abijlaard,p.p..Basme trans. 77, 1953..Wstresses from local loadings in cylindrical pressurevessels .  a short discussion is given of the possible methods forcomputing the stresses caused in cylindrical shells by localloadings .  it is concluded that the method of developingthe loads and displacements into double fourier seriesleads to formulas which are best suited for numericalevaluation .  with this method the pertinent expressionsfor the displacements caused by radial loads are found byreducing the three partial differential equations of theshell theory to an eighth-order differential equation in theradial displacements, which is similar to, but not identicalwith, those derived by donnell and yuan .  insertion of thefourier series for the radial displacements and the externalloading in this equation leads directly to a double seriesexpression of the radial displacement w in terms of the loadfactors of the radial load .  this results in the pertinentexpressions for the other displacements and for thebending moments and membrane forces .  the cases of radialloading considered here and those which can be reduced toit are (a) a load uniformly distributed within a rectangle,tion, uniformly distributed over a short distance in thecircumferential direction, (d) a moment in thecircumferential direction, uniformly distributed over a shortdistance in the longitudinal direction .  for all theseloadings the load factors, which have to be used in thepertinent formulas for the displacements, bendingmoments, and membrane forces, are computed .  for the caseof tangential loading an eighth-order differentialequation is derived in terms of the radial displacement and thetangential load .  using this equation, formulas for thedisplacements, bending moments, and membrane forces fortangential loading within a rectangle are found .
