plastic torsional buckling strength of cylinders includingthe effects of imperfections ..Alee,l.h.n. and ades,c.s..Bj. ae. scs. 24, 1957, 241..Wplastic torsional buckling strength of cylinders includingthe effects of imperfections .  the torsional buckling strength of a cylinder in the plasticrange has been determined .  an energy solution and a more exactsolution, both based on a plastic stress-strain relationship givenby the simple deformation theory, are presented .  closeagreement between the two solutions is found .  the effects of largedeflections and imperfections on buckling strength are analyzed .for two groups of experimental results used for comparison, theeffects of geometrical imperfections in the plastic range arenegligible .  the theoretical results are found to be in goodagreement with the experimental results .
