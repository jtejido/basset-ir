inviscid-incompressible-flow theory of static two-dimensionalsolid jets, in proximity to the ground ..Astrand,t..Bj. ae. scs. 1962, 170..Winviscid-incompressible-flow theory of static two-dimensionalsolid jets, in proximity to the ground .  the inviscid-incompressible-flow theory of static two-dimensional solid jets impinging orthogonally on the ground ispresented using conformal mapping methods .  it is shown that the thrust of a solid jet at constant powerinitially decreases as the ground is approached .  themagnitude of the thrust out of ground effect is regained only at a verylow height-to-jet width ratio (approximately 0.55) .  themaximuin decrease is about 6 percent .  the ground effect on solidjets is thus largely unfavorable .
