on the concept of stability of inelastic systems ..Adrucker,d.c. and onat,e.t..Bj.ae.scs., 21, 1954, 543..Won the concept of stability of inelastic systems .  simple models are employed to bring out the large andimportant differences between buckling in the plastic range andclassical elastic instability .  static and kinetic criteria arecompared and their interrelation discussed .  nonlinear behavior inparticular is often found to be the key to the physically validsolution .  the nonconservative nature of plastic deformation initself or in combination with the nonlinearity requires conceptsnot found in classical approaches .  conversely, the classicallinearized condition of neutral equilibrium is really not relevantin inelastic buckling .  plastic buckling loads are not uniquelydefined but cover a range of values and are often more properlythought of as maximum loads for some reasonable initialimperfection in geometry or dynamic disturbance .  the models indicate that basically the same information isobtained from essentially static systems by assuming initialimperfection in geometric forms as by assuming dynamicdisturbances .  one approach complements the other and both arehelpful in obtaining an understanding of the physical phenomena .
