design and operation of the n. g. t. e.  thermal shockanalogue ..Astanworth,c.g. and paine,d.s.c..Barc cp.557, 1960..Wdesign and operation of the n. g. t. e.  thermal shockanalogue .  a description is given of the n.g.t.e. thermal shock analogue whichis suitable for estimating the temperature in a turbine blade section asa function of position and time when the blade is subjected to a stepchange in gas temperature .  the method of operating the analogue andobtaining results has also been described .  the limitations of the analogue have been stated, but they areconsidered a small penalty in view of the essential simplicity of thedesign .
