general theory of airfoil sections having arbitraryshape or pressure distribution ..Aallen,h.j..Bnaca r833, 1945..Wgeneral theory of airfoil sections having arbitraryshape or pressure distribution .  in this report a theory of thin airfoils of small camber isdeveloped which permits either the velocity distributioncorresponding to a given airfoil shape, or the airfoil shapecorresponding to a given velocity distribution to be calculated .  theprocedures to be employed in these calculations are outlined andillustrated with suitable examples .
