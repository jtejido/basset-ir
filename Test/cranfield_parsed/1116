general instability of stiffened cylinders ..Abecker,h..Bnaca tn.4237, 1958..Wgeneral instability of stiffened cylinders .  theoretical buckling stressesare determined in explicit form forcircular cylinders withcircumferential and axial stiffening .  theloadings are axial compression, radialpressure, hydrostatic pressure,and torsion .  analyses were confinedto moderate-length and longcylinders .  the investigation was basedupon the use of a form of donnell'sequation derived by taylor which isapplicable to orthotropic cylinders .the derivation of this equation ispresented in this report .
