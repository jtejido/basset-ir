survey of inviscid hypersonic flow theory for geometricallyslender shapes ..Acrabtree,l.f..Brae tn. aero.2695, 1960..Wsurvey of inviscid hypersonic flow theory for geometricallyslender shapes .  a survey is made of existingtheories for the calculation of pressuredistributions on slender bodies athypersonic speeds .  no account is takenof boundary layer displacement effectswhich are expected to become importantabove a mach number of about 10 for a slender body .  first the breakdown of linearisedsupersonic theory is demonstrated asmach number increases above about 5, andthis is followed by a derivation ofthe hypersonic similarity rule .  thissection includes a description of thepiston-analogy .  next a physical interpretationof hypersonic flow is outlined and asimple derivation of the modifiednewtonian pressure formula is given .  the equations of flow throughan oblique shock wave are simplified byassuming a strong shock, and variousresults are thereby derived .  theseinclude the tangent-wedge and tangent-cone formulae .  this is followed by a descriptionof the newtonian approximation forslender bodies, including the effect ofcentrifugal forces, and the connectionwith newtonian flow theory is emphasized for .  the shock-expansion method isdescribed in some detail for bothtwo-and three-dimensional bodies, andfinally some remarks are made about theavailable data sheets and tables forestimating pressures on cones andogive-cylinders in yaw .  the note does not claim to beoriginal, even in presentation .  the aimhas been to prepare a reasonably completesurvey of available theory forhypersonic flow over slender bodies, excludingviscous and explicit real gas effects .  this will provide the backgroundfor further work in which experimentaldata will be analysed and in conjunctionwith which it is hoped to produceaccurate design methods for estimatingpressures and forces on shapes intendedfor sustained flight at hypersonic speeds .
