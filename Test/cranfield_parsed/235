on the minimisation and numerical evaluation of wavedrag ..Aeminton,e..Brae r.aero.2564..Won the minimisation and numerical evaluation of wavedrag .  a fourier analysis of the linearised theory expression for thezero-lift wave drag of a smooth, slender body in terms of itscross-sectional area distribution is usedto derive the area distribution whichminimises the expression for givenlength, volume, nose area, base areaand n intermediate areas .  anotherminimal deduced from this by relaxingthe restriction on volume is used toevolve a method for the numericalevaluation of the original expression .  two practical applications of theseresults are discussed .  the firstis in the design of wing-body combinationsto have small drag rise attransonic speeds .  the second is in thecalculation of the wave drag ofwing-body combinations at zero lift,.an example is constructed toillustrate the method and to give an indication of its accuracy .
