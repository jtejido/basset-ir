an investigation of the noise produced by a subsonic air jet ..Aj. h. gerrard.Buniversity of manchester.Wan investigation of the noise produced by a subsonic air jet .to investigate the theoretical predictions of lighthill on aerodynamicsound, measurements have been made of the sound field of a 1 in. air jetissuing from a long pipe .  the measurements have been made over a widefrequency band (30 to 10,000 cycles/sec.) and in one-third octave bandsin this frequency range .   the mean mach number at the pipe orifice wasvaried from 0.3 to 1.0 .the dependence of the apparent position of the noise sources onfrequency and jet speed was investigated .  at a given frequency a source issituated farther from the jet orifice the higher the jet speed .  lowerfrequency sources appear farther downstream than ones of higherfrequency, consistent with their association with larger eddies .  thedirectional characteristics of the sound field at different frequenciesand jet speeds are illustrated by means of scale diagrams showing linesof constant sound intensity .  these sound fields are analyzed in termsof the moving quadrupole sources of lighthill's theory and goodagreement obtained .  it is shown that the apparent spread of the sources atlow frequencies is due to the doppler effect .  at low frequencyrelative to the frequency of maximum power output) the radiation ispredominantly that of three mutually orthogonal longitudinal quadrupoleswhich, except for the effect of convection upon it, has a sound fieldlike a monopole source .  at higher frequencies the sound fields oflateral and longitudinal quadrupoles predominate .
