effects of imperfections on buckling of thin cylindersand columns under axial compression ..Adonnell,l.h. and wan,c.c..Bj. app. mech. 1950..Weffects of imperfections on buckling of thin cylindersand columns under axial compression .  von karman and tsien have shown that under elasticconditions the resistance of perfect thin cylinderssubjected to axial compression drops precipitously afterbuckling .  it is considered that this indicates that this type ofbuckling is very sensitive to imperfections or disturbances .in this paper the effects of certain imperfections of shapeturbances combined) are studied by the large-deflectionshell theory developed in a previous paper (2) .  it is found that two types of buckling failure may occur .one is of a purely elastic type which occurs when the peakof the average stress versus average strain curve is reached,while the other type is precipitated by yielding, which forthicker cylinders or lower-yield material may occur beforesuch a peak is reached .  curves are derived giving thedependence of each type of failure upon the dimensions andelastic and yield properties of the specimen and also uponan /unevenness factor/ u which determines themagnitude of the initial imperfections and is assumed to dependon the method of fabrication .  the relations derived are inline with test results, and similar studies of the bucklingof struts indicate that the magnitude of the initialimperfections which have to be assumed to explain test strengthsare reasonable .
