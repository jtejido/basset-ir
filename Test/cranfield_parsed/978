temperature profiles inafinite solid with moving boundary ..Adewey, c.f., schlesinger, s.i. and sashkin, l..Bj. aero. sc. v. 27, 1960 ..Wtemperature profiles inafinite solid with moving boundary .a numerical solution is presented to the transient heat conductionequation for a cylinder of finite thickness with one moving boundary .the implicit method of solution is developed with conductivity as anarbitrary function of temperature . application is made to a sample case of re-entry heating encountered by aerodynamic bodies, with erosion bysublimation and combustion occurring at the body surface .
