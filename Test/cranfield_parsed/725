the response of a typical aircraft structure to jetnoise ..Aclarkson,b.l. and ford,r.d..Bj. roy. aero. soc. 1962..Wthe response of a typical aircraft structure to jetnoise .  an analysis is made of experimentally determined mode shapesexcited on the rear structure of a modern airliner by jet noise froma pod-mounted turbojet engine .  power spectra of stressesdetermined from strain-gage measurements are obtained and crosscorrelated .  extensive measurements were made on skin panels of thefuselage and elevator and limited ones were made on fuselagestringers and frames .  the skin-panel results are compared withtheoretical predictions .  reviewer believes that this paper is ofconsiderable value for those concerned with response ofaircraft-type structures to jet-induced noise .
