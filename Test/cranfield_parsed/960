investigation of free turbulent mixing ..Aliepman,h.w. and laufer,j..Bnaca tn.1257, 1947..Winvestigation of free turbulent mixing .  a discussion of the integralrelations for flow of theboundary-layer type is presented .  it isshown that the characteristic laws ofspread of jets, wakes, and so forth,can be obtained directly for thelaminar case and, with the help ofdimensional reasoning, for theturbulent case as well .  measurements of the mean velocity,the intensity and scale of theturbulent fluctuations, and of the turbulentshear in a two-dimensionalmixing zone are presented .  the results ofthese measurements arecompared with the mixing-length theories .  itis shown that both mixinglength and exchange coefficient vary acrossthe mixing zone .  thetheories based on the assumption of constantmixing length or exchangecoefficient are thus in error .  a discussion of the energy balance ofthe fluctuating motion isgiven and the triple correlation is estimated .
