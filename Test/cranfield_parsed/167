linearized flow of a dissociating gas ..Aclarke,j.f..Bj.fluid mech. 7, 1960, 577..Wlinearized flow of a dissociating gas .the equations for planar two-dimensionalsteady flow of an ideal dissociating gasare linearized, assuming small disturbancesto a free stream in chemicalequilibrium .  as an example of their solution, theflow past a sharp corner in a supersonicstream is evaluated and the variationsof flow properties in the relaxation zoneare found .  numerical illustrations areprovided using an 'oxygen-like' ideal gasand comparisons made with a characteristicssolution .  the flow past a sharpcorner can be studied in a conventionalshock tube and it may be possible toverify the present theory experimentally .in particular it may prove feasible touse the results to obtain a measure of thereaction rates in the gas mixture .
