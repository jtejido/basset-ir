axisymmetric free mixing with swirl ..Asteiger,m.h. and bloom,m.h..Bpibal r.628..Waxisymmetric free mixing with swirl .  viscous laminar axially-symmetricfree-mixing with small, moderate,and large swirl is investigated by aboundary layer type of analysis withintegral methods .  moderate and smallswirls are formally the same,differing only in the order of their associatedradial pressure gradients .  neitherinduces significant axial pressure gradients,.consequently their effect on theaxial flow is negligible .  for moderate andsmall swirl an interesting featureis the swirl decay .  in both compressibleand incompressible flow, it isshown that jet swirl decays more rapidlythan wake swirl whereas both swirlsdecay more rapidly than the non-uniformityin axial velocity .  large swirlgenerates axial pressure gradients as wellas large radial pressure gradients,and therefore alters the streamwise flow .examples calculated forincompressible flow, show that the wake islengthened by large swirl .  it isexpected that this effect will be diminishedin the presence of higher free-streammach numbers which lead to decreaseddensities, due to decreasedcentrifugal effects, decreased radial pressuregradients, and decreased axialpressure gradients .
