investigaion of the flow over a spiked-nose hemispherecylinder at a mach number of 6. 8..Acrawford,d.h..Bnasa tn.d118, 1959..Winvestigaion of the flow over a spiked-nose hemispherecylinder at a mach number of 6. 8.  the shape and nature of theflow over a spiked-nosehemisphere-cylinder was studied in detailat a nominal mach number of 6.8 and in areynolds number range (based ondiameter and stream conditions ahead ofthe model) of 0.12 x 10 to 1.5 x 10 .schlieren photographs showedthe effect of varying the spike lengthand reynolds number upon the shapeof the separated boundary and upon thelocation of transition .  the heattransfer and pressure distribution overthe body were then correlatedwith the location of the start ofseparation, the location ofreattachment, and the location of the start oftransition .
