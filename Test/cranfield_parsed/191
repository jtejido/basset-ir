a theory for the core of a leading edge vortex ..Ahall,m.g..Brae r.aero.2644, 1960..Wa theory for the core of a leading edge vortex .  in the flow past a slender delta wingat incidence can be observed aroughly axially symmetric core of spirallingfluid, formed by the rolling upof the shear layer that separates from aleading edge .  the aim in thisreport is to predict the flow field withinthis vortex core, givenappropriate conditions at its outside edge .  the basic assumptions arecore .in addition it is assumed that the flowis axially symmetric and incompressible .together, these admit outer and innersolutions for the core from the equationsof motion .  for the outer solution the sub-coreis ignored, and the flow is taken tobe inviscid (but rotational) and conical .the resulting solution consists ofsimple expressions for the velocity componentsand pressure .  for the innersolution, which applies to the diffusivesub-core, the flow is taken to belaminar, and approximations, some based onthe boundary conditions and someanalogous to those of boundary layer theory,are made .  the solution obtainedin this case is a first approximation, and ispresented in tabular form .  a sample calculation yields resultswhich are in good qualitative andfair quantitative agreement with experimental measurements .
