viscous flow round a sphere at low reynolds numbers . /l40/ ..Ajenson, v.g..Bproc. roy. soc. series, a. v. 249, p. 346, 1959 ..Wviscous flow round a sphere at low reynolds numbers . /l40/ .relaxation methods are outlined, and the present problem formulated inmodified spherical polar co-ordinates . the results of calculations made  for r 5, 10, 20, 40 are presented in the form of stream function andvorticity distributions,. and further results of pressure distributions, velocity distributions, and drag coefficients, calculated from them .these results are shown to compare favourably with experimental work,showing a steady trend from symmetrical stokes's flow, towards boundarylayer flow . the phenomenon of separation of the forward flow anddevelopment of a circulating wake, is explained and illustrated, the firstformation of a wake being at r 17 .
