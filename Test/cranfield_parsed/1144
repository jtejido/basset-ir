slipstream flow around several tilt-wing vtol aircraft modelsoperating near the ground ..Awilliam a. newsom, jr., and louis p. tosti.Btechnical note d-1382.Wslipstream flow around several tilt-wing vtol aircraft modelsoperating near the ground .a collection of data from a number of brief investigations made withthree different models to determine the character of the slipstream flowalong the ground is presented for multiple-propeller tilt-wing vtolaircraft configurations operating near the ground .  in general, the testsinvolved tuft surveys and slipstream dynamic-pressure measurements forseveral tilt-wing vtol models .  a more extensive series of tests,including some measurements of the erosion of gravel by the slipstreamand some measurements of the unsteady rolling, yawing, and pitchingmoments, was also made on one of the models operating in the hoveringcondition near the ground .the results of the flow studies indicated the presence of a strongerand deeper slipstream flow along the center line of the aircraft, and tosome extent along parallel planes between adjacent propellers (on onewing), than to the side of the aircraft .  this effect is caused by anintensification of the individual slipstreams as they meet at the planesof flow symmetry .  the intensified flow along the center line of theaircraft is amplified by the presence of the fuselage and causes thedynamic pressure to be greater in front of the aircraft than would beexpected on the basis of the slipstream of the individual propellers .in the erosion tests it was found that gravel, if sufficiently small,was rapidly eroded by the slipstream and that this gravel could bethrown high into the air if it struck even very small fixed obstacles onthe ground (obstacles with a height less than the diameter of thegravel) .  results of the investigation of moment fluctuationsindicated that there are large, erratic variations of rolling, yawing,and pitching moments and that the propellers, reacting to an erraticinflow from the recirculating slipstream, are the primary source ofthese moments .
