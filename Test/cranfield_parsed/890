comments on 'thermal buckling of clamped cylindrical shells' ..Adavid j. johns.Blecturer, college of aeronautics, cranfield, england.Wcomments on 'thermal buckling of clamped cylindrical shells' .in the recent paper by zuk, an expression was presented forthe critical buckling temperature of a clamped cylindrical shellin terms of the material and geometrical properties of the shell .restraint at the edges of the shell was assumed to be provided byrigid frames experiencing no temperature rise .the circumferential stress induced in the shell when it experienceda temperature rise, t, may be approximated by the function .in other words, there is a compressive circumferential stress alongthe entire length, l, of the shell .it is well known, however, that the discontinuity stresses introduced atthe junction of a shell and a rigid frame (or bulk-head) are extremelylocalized, and the circumferential stresses induced in the shelldecrease rapidly away from the joint .
