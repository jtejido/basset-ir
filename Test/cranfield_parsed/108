properties of the confluent hypergeometric function ..Aa. d. macdonald.B.Wproperties of the confluent hypergeometric function .the confluent hypergeometric functions have proved useful in manybranches of physics .  they have been used in such problems involvingdiffusion and sedimentation, as isotope separation and protein molecularweight determinations in the ultracentrifuge .  the solution of theequation for the velocity distribution of electrons in high frequencygas discharges may frequently be expressed in terms of these functions .the high frequency breakdown electric field may then be predictedtheoretically for gases by the use of such solutions together with kinetictheory .this report presents some of the properties of the confluenthypergeometric functions together with six-figure tables of the functions .
