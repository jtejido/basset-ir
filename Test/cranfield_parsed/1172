elastic stability of circular cylindrical shells stabilizedby a soft elastic core ..Agoree,w.s. and nash,w.a..Bexp. mech. 2, 1962..Welastic stability of circular cylindrical shells stabilizedby a soft elastic core .  the effect of a soft elastic core upon thebuckling strength of a thin, circular, cylindrical shell isinvestigated experimentally .  two types of loading areconsidered ..  (a) axial compression, and (b) uniformradial-band loading, where the width of the band is smallcompared to the length of the shell .  for each type of loading it is shown that thestrengthening effect of the elastic core becomes more significantwith the increasing values of the radius-thickness ratio .for example, it is shown that for the geometric andelastic constants considered it is possible, with the presenceof the core, to increase the axial buckling stress by asmuch as 65 percent over the values found for thosewithout an elastic core .  the elastic core is even moreeffective in stabilizing the shell against buckling due to bandloading, the peak pressure required to buckle the filledspecimen being 7.30 times that required to buckle theunfilled shell .
