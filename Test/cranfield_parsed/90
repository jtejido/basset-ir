periodic temperature distributions in a two-layer compositeslab ..Astonecypher,t.e..Bj. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 152..Wperiodic temperature distributions in a two-layer compositeslab .an investigation to determine the feasibility of using aninsulating thermal barrier to protect exposed solidpropellant motors from atmospheric or environmental temperaturevariations has recently been completed .  in one portion of thisstudy, a solution was developed for the periodic temperaturedistribution in a two-layer composite slab .  one exposed surface ofthis composite slab was adiabatic, and the other exposed surfacewas subjected to a sinusoidal temperature variation .  thetechnique used in the analysis was similar to that of grober .  in thisnote, pertinent features of the development of the solution aregiven .
