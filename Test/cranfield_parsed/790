a wind-tunnel test technique for measuring the dynamic rotarystability derivatives at subsonic and supersonic speeds ..Areport 1258.Bbenjamin h. beam.Wa wind-tunnel test technique for measuring the dynamic rotarystability derivatives at subsonic and supersonic speeds .a method is described for measuring the dynamic stability derivativesof a model airplane in a wind tunnel .  the characteristic featuresof this system are that single-degree-of-freedom oscillations wereused to obtain combinations of rolling, yawing and pitching motions.,that the oscillations were excited and controlled by velocity feedbackwhich permitted operation under conditions unfavorable for moreconventional types of oscillatory testing., and that data processing wasgreatly simplified by using analog computer elements in the strain-gagecircuitry .the system described is primarily for measurement of the dampingderivatives dampingin roll damping in pitch, damping in yaw, and the cross derivativesrolling moment due to yawing and yawing moment due to rolling .  themethod of testing also permits measurement under oscillatory conditionsof the static derivatives rolling moment due to sideslip, yawing momentdue to sideslip, and pitching moment due to angle of attack .  all thesederivatives are of particular importance in estimating the short-periodoscillatory motions of a rigid airplane .a small number of experimental data are included to illustrate thegeneral scope of results obtainable with this system .
