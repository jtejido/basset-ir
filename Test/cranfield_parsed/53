transition reynolds numbers of separated flows atsupersonic speeds ..Alarson,h.k. and keating,s.j..Bnasa tn.d349, 1960..Wtransition reynolds numbers of separated flows atsupersonic speeds .  experimental research has been conducted on the effects of wallcooling, mach number, and unit reynoldsnumber on the transition reynoldsnumber of cylindrical separated boundarylayers on an ogive-cylinder model .results were obtained from pressure and temperature measurements andshadowgraph observations .  the maximumscope of measurements encompassedmach numbers between 2.06 and 4.24, reynolds numbers (based on length ofseparation) between 60,000 and 400,000,and ratios of wall temperature toadiabatic wall temperature between 0.35 and 1.0 .within the range of thepresent tests, the transition reynolds number was observed to decreasewith increasing wall cooling, increase with increasing mach number, andincrease with increasing unit reynolds number .  the wall-cooling effectwas found to be four times as great when the attached boundary layerupstream of separation was cooled in conjunction with cooling of theseparated boundary layer as when only the separated boundary layer wascooled .  wall cooling of both theattached and separated flow regions alsocaused, in some cases, reattachment in the otherwise separated region .cavity resonance present in the separated region for some modelconfigurations was accompanied by a large decrease in transition reynoldsnumber at the lower test mach numbers .
