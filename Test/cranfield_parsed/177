the mixing of free axially-symmetrical jets of mach number 1.40 ..An. h. johannesen.Bdepartment of the mechanics of fluids, university of manchestercommunicated by the director-general of scientific research (air),ministry of supply.Wthe mixing of free axially-symmetrical jets of mach number 1.40 .axially-symmetrical, supersonic, fully-expanded jets of diameterabout 0.75 in. and of mach number 1.40 issuing into an atmosphereat rest were investigated by schlieren and shadow photography andby pressure traversing .  the development of the jets was found todepend critically on the strength of the shock waves in the core of thejet at the nozzle exit .  with strong shock waves present the jet spreadvery rapidly and was very unsteady .  the jet did in some cases break upinto large eddies of the same size as the diameter of the jet .  whenno disturbances were present in the core of the jet the spreadingwas far more gradual and the jet showed only slight unsteadiness .the turbulent mixing region of the first part of the jet with strongshock waves was investigated in detail by pitot tubes .  the firstinch was found to correspond to a two-dimensional half-jet .  thevelocity profiles were similar and well represented by the errorintegral .  the rate of spreading was only half the value forlow-speed flow .  by integrations across the mixing region theentrainment and the loss of kinetic energy were determined .these quantities were found to agree well with the values estimated byassuming an error-integral velocity profile .
