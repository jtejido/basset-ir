the equilibrium piston technique for gun tunnel operation ..Aeast,r.a. and pennelegion,l..Barc 22, 852, 1961..Wthe equilibrium piston technique for gun tunnel operation .  a modified technique for the operation of a gun tunnel issuggested based on experimental results .  if the piston mass and theinitial barrel pressure are chosen correctly, then the peak pressuresassociated with the gun tunnel may be eliminated .  under theseconditions the piston is brought to rest with no overswing .  somemeasurements of the piston motion using a microwave technique arereported which confirm this idea .  the wave diagram associated with this mode of operation isshown, and some calculations of the stagnation pressure are given whichshow that during the suggested running time, the stagnation pressuremay be considerably greater than the driving pressure if the drivingchamber cross-sectional area is large compared with that of the drivensection .  for a uniform shock tube the stagnation pressure will alwaysbe less than the driving pressure .  the use of air, helium andhydrogen as driving gases has been considered .  experiments in a gun tunnel are reported which show that theequilibrium piston technique enables steady stagnation pressures to beachieved over a time of approximately 15 ms using air as the drivinggas .  the expansion caused by the piston acceleration is shown tointeract with the stationary piston, but this is found to produce only asmall drop in stagnation pressure .
