numerical determination of indical lift of a two-dimensional sinkingairfoil at subsonic mach numbers from oscillatory lift coefficients with calculations for mach number 0.7 ..Amazelsky, b..Bnaca tn 2562, 1951 ..Wnumerical determination of indical lift of a two-dimensional sinkingairfoil at subsonic mach numbers from oscillatory lift coefficients with calculations for mach number 0.7 .the reciprocal equations for relating the incompressible circulatoryindicial lift to the lift due to harmonic oscillations have beenmodified to include the noncirculatory lift associated withapparent-mass effects . although the apparent-mass effects are impulsive innature in incompressible flow, the lift due to apparent-mass effects incompressible flow is a time-dependent function . the correspondingreciprocal equations for the total compressible lift are given . by useof the reciprocal equations for compressible flow, the indicial lift and moment functions due to an airfoil's experiencing a sudden acquisitionof vertical velocity are determined numerically for mach number 0.7 .lack of sufficient flutter coefficients prevents the calculation ofthese functions at other mach numbers .although the indicial lift and moment functions due to penetration of asharp-edge gust may be obtained from the oscillatory tab or aileroncoefficients by a similar analysis, sufficient coefficients are notavailable at the present . however, an approximate method is shown fordetermining a portion of this unsteady-lift function .when a comparison is made of the indicial lift functions at mach numbersappears to be less rapid for the compressible case than for theincompressible case . consequently, the calculation of the gust load factorat high subsonic mach numbers utilizing the two-dimensionalincompressible indicial lift functions and an over-all correction forcompressibility such as the prandtl-glauert factor might be conservative .
