experiments on boundary layer transition atsupersonic speeds ..Avan driest,e.r. and boison,j.c..Bj. ae. scs. 24, 1957, 885..Wexperiments on boundary layer transition atsupersonic speeds .  tests were conducted in the 12-in. continuous supersonic windtunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory, california institute oftechnology, to determine the effects of surface cooling onboundary-layer transition at supersonic speeds .  the effects ofcooling were investigated at test section mach numbers of 1.97,smooth cone in the presence of three levels of supply-streamturbulence (0.4, 2, and 9 per cent) and several single-elementroughnesses at fixed axial location .  transition data were obtainedoptically by means of a magnified-schlieren system .  the results,for the range of mach number investigated, indicate that (1)transition on a smooth cone can definitely be delayed by surfacecooling, (2) transition promoted by either supply-streamturbulence or surface roughness can also be delayed by surface coolingdepending upon degree of turbulence or relative roughnessrespectively, and (3) the adverse effects of increased turbulence androughness decrease with increasing mach number .
