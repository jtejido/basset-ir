analysis of stresses in the elements of shell structure ..Ac. e. taylor ande. wenk, jr..Bstructural research engineer, david taylor model basin head,structures division, david taylor model basin.Wanalysis of stresses in the elements of shell structure .the love-meissner analysis for thin shells has previously been appliedto cones of uniform wall thickness, and solutions for the stressresultants were given in terms of kelvin's functions . sincetabulation of these functions for large arguments is not practical,considerable computation was still required .  in the present paper, the authorsdefine special functions which eliminate the necessity of evaluatingkelvin/s functions and which may be used with simple algebraic andtrigonometric functions to compute the boundary forces and displacementsfor cones for various loading conditions .  these special functions alsomake clear the magnitude of errors which result from geckeler/s andother approximate solutions .
