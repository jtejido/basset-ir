the application of lighthill formula for numericalcalculation of pressure distributions on bodies ofrevolution at supersonic speed and zero angle of attack ..Aohman,l..Bsaab tn.45, 1960..Wthe application of lighthill formula for numericalcalculation of pressure distributions on bodies ofrevolution at supersonic speed and zero angle of attack .an integral expression, given by lighthill and basedon linearized theory, for the externalsupersonic flow over the surface of slender pointedor ducted bodies of revolution at zeroangle of attack is shown to give a good approximationof the exact flow for a much wider machnumber and thickness range than could be expected fromlinearized theory .  a numerical method,based on this expression, is developed and applied fordigital computing .  some results fromapplying the digital computing procedure for determiningthe pressure distribution and wavedrag for various bodies of revolution are given .
