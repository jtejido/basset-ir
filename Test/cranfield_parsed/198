investigation of a systematic group of naca 1 - seriescowlings with and without spinners ..Anichols,m.r. and keith,a.l..Bnaca r950, 1949..Winvestigation of a systematic group of naca 1 - seriescowlings with and without spinners .  an investigation has been conducted in the langleypropeller-research tunnel to study cowling-spinner combinations basedon the naca 1-series nose inlets and to obtain systematicdesign data for one family of approximately ellipsoidal spinners .in the main part of the investigation, 11 of the related spinnerswere tested in various combinations with 9 naca open-nosecowlings, which were also tested without spinners .  the effectsof location and shape of the spinner, shape of the inner surfaceof the cowling lip, and operation of a propeller havingapproximately oval shanks were investigated briefly .  in addition, astudy was conducted to determine the correct procedure forextrapolating design conditions determined from the low-speedtest data to the design conditions at the actual flight machnumber .  the design conditions for the naca 1-series cowlings andcowling-spinner combinations are presented in the form ofcharts from which, for wide ranges of spinner proportions andrates of internal flow, cowlings with near-maximum pressurerecovery can be selected for critical mach numbers ranging fromspinners and the effects of the spinners and the propeller onthe cowling design conditions are presented separately toprovide initial quantitative data for use in a general designprocedure through which naca 1-series cowlings can beselected for use with spinners of other shapes .  by use of thisgeneral design procedure, correlation curves established fromthe test data, and derived compressible-flow equations relatingthe inlet-velocity ratio to the surface pressures on the cowlingand spinner, naca 1-series cowlings and cowling-spinnercombinations can be designed for critical mach numbers ashigh as 0.90 .
