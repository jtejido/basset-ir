analysis and calculation by integral methods of laminarcompressible boundary layer with heat transfer andwith and without pressure gradient ..Amorduchow,m..Bnaca r.1245, 1955..Wanalysis and calculation by integral methods of laminarcompressible boundary layer with heat transfer andwith and without pressure gradient .  a survey of integral methods in laminar-boundary-layeranalysis is first given .  a simple and sufficiently accuratemethod for practical purposes of calculating the propertieslayer in an axial pressure gradient with heat transfer at thewall is then presented .  for flow over a flat plate, the methodis applicable for an arbitrarily prescribed distribution oftemperature along the surface and for any given constantprandtl number close to unity .  for flow in a pressure gradient,the method is based on a prandtl number of unity and a uniformwall temperature .  a simple and accurate method ofdetermining the separation point in a compressible flow with an adversepressure gradient over a surface at a given uniform walltemperature is developed .  the analysis is based on an extension ofthe karman-pohlhausen method to the momentum and thermalenergy equations in conjunction with fourth- and especiallyhigher degree velocity and stagnation-enthalpy profiles .  fromthe equations derived here, conclusions regarding the effect ofpressure gradient, mach number, and wall temperature on theboundary-layer characteristics are derived and illustrated .  inparticular the effects on skin-friction, heat-transfer coefficient,separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, and stabilityof the laminar boundary layer are analyzed .
