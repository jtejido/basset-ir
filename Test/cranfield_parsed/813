the motion of rolling symmetrical missiles referredto a body-axis system ..Anelson,r.l..Bnaca tn.3737, 1956..Wthe motion of rolling symmetrical missiles referredto a body-axis system .  the linearized equations of motion have been derived for a rollingmissile having slight aerodynamic asymmetries .  time histories ofrolling-missile motions referred to a body-axis system have beenprepared to show the types of missile motions that can be encountered .the motions resulting from a trim change and a pulse-rocket disturbanceare shown to be determined mainly by the ratio of rolling velocity topitching frequency .  finally, the derived equations are used in establishing a techniquefor the reduction of rolling-missile oscillation data .  it is shownthat the aerodynamic derivatives can be obtained from flight data iffour accelerations are measured .  the method is applied to the resultsobtained from a flight test of a missile configuration .
