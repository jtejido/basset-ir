some results on buckling and postbuckling of cylindricalshells ..Akempner,j..Bnasa tn.d1510, 1962, 173..Wsome results on buckling and postbuckling of cylindricalshells .  in this summary paper, theeffects of initial deformations on thebuckling and postbuckling characteristicsof circular cylindricalshells under hydrostatic pressureis determined in an approximatemanner .  the influence of initialaxisymmetric deformations is stressed .also, the classical buckling ofan axially compressed, noncircularthe results show that themajor-minor axis ratio of the cross sectionhas a marked effect on thecritical load, and that use of themaximum radius of curvature in theformula for the classical bucklingstress of a circular cylindricalshell leads to good results for moderateeccentricities .
