base pressure at supersonic speeds in the presenceof a supersonic jet ..Acraven,a.h..Bcoa r.144, 1960..Wbase pressure at supersonic speeds in the presenceof a supersonic jet .  the effects on base pressure of jet mach number, free streamreynolds number and jet to base diameter ratio have been investigatedexperimentally .  it was found that, for jet stagnation pressures greater than thatrequired for the nozzle to reach its design mach number, an increaseof jet mach number reduced the base pressure .  similarly the basepressure increased with increase of the ratio of jet diameter to basediameter and, at high jet stagnation pressures, base pressures higherthan free stream static pressure were found .  the base pressure wasindependent of free stream reynolds numbers greater than 2 x 10 perfoot but increased with reduction of reynolds number below 2 x 10 perfoot .  unsteady wave patterns were found when the jet mach number didnot differ markedly from the free stream mach number and the jet hadjust reached its design conditions .
