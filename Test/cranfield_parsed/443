calculated and measured pressure distributions over the midspan sectionof the naca 4412 airfoil ..Apinkerton, r. m..Bnaca r. 563, 1936 ..Wcalculated and measured pressure distributions over the midspan sectionof the naca 4412 airfoil .pressures were simultaneously measured in the variable-density tunnelat 54 orifices distributed over the midspan section of a 5 by 30 inchrectangular model of the n.a.c.a. 4412 airfoil at 17 angles of attackranging from -dash 20degree to 30degree at a reynolds number ofapproximately 3,000,000 . accurate data were thus obtained for studying thedeviations of the results of potential-flow theory from measured resultstechnique are presented .it is shown that theoretical calculations made either at the effectiveangle of attack or at a given actual lift do not accurately describe the observed pressure distribution over an airfoil section . there istherefore developed a modified theoretical calculation that agreesreasonably well with the measured results of the tests of the n.a.c.a. 4412 section and that consists of making the calculations and evaluating the circulation by means of the experimentally obtained lift at theeffective angle of attack,. i.e., the angle that the chord of the model makes with the direction of the flow in the region of the section underconsideration . in the course of the computations the shape parameteris modified, thus leading to a modified or an effective profile shapethat differs slightly from the specified shape .
