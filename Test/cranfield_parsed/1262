an extension of the linearized characteristics methodfor calculating the supersonic flow around ellipticcones ..Amartellucci,a..Bj. ae. scs. 1960, 667..Wan extension of the linearized characteristics methodfor calculating the supersonic flow around ellipticcones .  the method of linearized characteristics as applied by ferri tothe flow about elliptic cones can be used to determine the surfacepressure distribution, even when only linear terms are kept in theboundary conditions, provided an area rule requirement issatisfied .  in addition, the method can be applied for angles of attackprovided the elliptic body geometry is specified in a manner thatdoes not distort the cross section .  the surface pressuredistribution obtained by this modified method is in reasonableagreement with experiment over the range of mach numbers andsemidiameter ratios considered .  experimental results for severalconical bodies are presented .
