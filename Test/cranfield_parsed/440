compilation of information on the transonic attachmentof flows at the leading edge of airfoils ..Alindsey,w.f. and landrum,e..Bnaca tn.4204, 1958..Wcompilation of information on the transonic attachmentof flows at the leading edge of airfoils .  schlieren photographs have been compiled of the two-dimensional flowat transonic speeds past 37 airfoils having variously shaped profiles,some of which are related and vary in thickness and camber .  the datafor these airfoils were analyzed to provide basic information on theflow changes involved and to determine factors affecting transonic-flowattachment, which is a transition from separated to unseparated flow atthe leading edges of two-dimensional airfoils at fixed angles of attackas the subsonic mach number is increased .
