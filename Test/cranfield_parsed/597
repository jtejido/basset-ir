measurements of pitching moment derivatives for blunt-nose aerofoilsoscillating in two-dimensional supersonic flow ..Apugh, p.g. and woodgate, l..Barc. 23, 012, 1961 ..Wmeasurements of pitching moment derivatives for blunt-nose aerofoilsoscillating in two-dimensional supersonic flow .direct pitching moment derivatives have been measured using the methodof scruton, woodgate et al for two single wedge blunt-nosed aerofoils .these measurements were made at mach numbers of 1.75 and 2.47 andfrequency parameters less than 0.02 . in general, nose blunting was foundto have little effect on the derivatives although changes were observedfor the thinner wedge at a mach number of 1.75 .
