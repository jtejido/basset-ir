slender not-so-thin wing theory ..Acooke,j.c..Brae r.aero.2660, 1962..Wslender not-so-thin wing theory .  a method for making an approximate thickness correction to slenderthin-wing theory is presented .  the method is tested by applying it tocones with rhombic cross-sections and the agreement is found to be goodif the cones are not too thick .  it is then suggested that thethickness correction to slender thin-wing theory may be appliedunchanged to linear thin-wing theory .  this suggestion is compared withsome experiments on delta wings and it is found that there isconsiderable improvement over thin-wing theory near the centre line, but thatthis improvement is not maintained as the wing tips are approached .
