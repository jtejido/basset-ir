on the steady motion of viscous, incompressible fluids,with particular reference to a variation principle ..Amillikan,c.b..Bphil.mag. 7, 1929, 641..Won the steady motion of viscous, incompressible fluids,with particular reference to a variation principle .  except in exceptional cases, it is not possible to represent themotion of a viscous incompressible liquid by means of a variationprinciple, but all cases of such motion that have yet been discoveredbelong to this class of /exceptional cases ./  the appropriate functionsare given .
