incompressible nonviscous blade-to-blade flow through a pump rotor withsplitter vanes ..Akramer, j.j. et al..Bnasa tn d-1186, 1962 ..Wincompressible nonviscous blade-to-blade flow through a pump rotor withsplitter vanes .the nonviscous flow through a mixed-flow pump impeller having onesplitter vane between adjacent main blades has been analyzed on ablade-to-blade surface of revolution using a previously reportedanalysis method . solutions were obtained for a variety of flowconditions including several cases in which whirl is imparted to theflow upstream of the impeller .the velocity distributions on the main-blade surfaces and on thesplitter-vane surfaces in the region of the splitter vane were stronglydependent on the assumed location of the rear stagnation points .solutions were obtained by assuming values of slip factor and of division of flow around the splitter in addition to assuming the location of therear stagnation points . these solutions indicated that the velocitydistributions in the splitter-vane region are largely determined by thedivision of flow around the splitter vane and that only the region inthe immediate vicinity of the trailing edge is affected by the slipfactor .blade surface velocities were obtained from two approximate methods byspecifying flow division and slip factor, and these results are compared with the more exact solutions of the analysis .
