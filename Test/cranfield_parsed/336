simplified laminar boundary layer calculations forbodies of revolution and for yawed wings ..Arott,n. and crabtree,l.f..Bj. ae. scs. 19, 1962..Wsimplified laminar boundary layer calculations forbodies of revolution and for yawed wings .  since the introduction of momentum methods inboundary-layer calculations by von karman and pohlhausen, manyimprovements have been proposed .  an especially simple solutionreduces the problem to a quadrature .  here, it is proposed toextend these methods to elementary three-dimensional cases and tocompressible laminar boundary-layer calculations .  forcomparison, the corresponding problems for the turbulent boundarylayer are also discussed briefly .
