a theoretical and experimental study of oscillating wedge shapedaerofoils in hypersonic flow ..Ar. a. east.B.Wa theoretical and experimental study of oscillating wedge shapedaerofoils in hypersonic flow .aerodynamic stiffness and damping derivatives have been measuredin a /hypersonic gun/ wind tunnel for sharp and blunt-nosed twodimensional single wedge shapes oscillating in the pitching mode inhypersonic flow .  the results, which have been compared withtheoretical prediction, modified to account for leading edge bluntness,show that this may increase the damping by up to 50 percent for certainaxis positions .  details of the experimental technique designed tomeasure the derivatives in the short running times available aredescribed .
