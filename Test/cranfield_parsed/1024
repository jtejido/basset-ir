note on creep buckling of columns ..A.B.Wnote on creep buckling of columns .  the general dynamic equation ofcreep bending of a beam loadedlaterally and axially was derived for alinearly viscoelastic material whosemechanical properties can be characterizedby four parameters .  thematerial can exhibit instantaneous and retardedelasticity as well as pureflow .  the equation derived was used toobtain the creep bending deflectionof a beam in pure bending and of a columnwith initial sinusoidaldeviation from straightness .  as expected, theratio of the creep deflectionsof the beam in pure bending and thedeflections of a corresponding purelyelastic structure is identical to theratio of the creep strain and thecorresponding elastic strain of a barunder simple tension or compression .  the results of the analysis of thecreep deflection of the columnshowed that the deflections increasecontinuously with time and becomeinfinitely large only when the loadingtime is correspondingly large .however, large deflections are obtainedin reasonably short periods oftime if the applied load is near to theeuler load of the column .  thedeflection-time curves obtained from anumerical example are of the sametype as those determined by experimentwith aluminum columns .
