experimental study of the random vibrations of an aircraftstructure excited by jet noise ..Aclarkson,b.l. and ford,r.d..Bu.s.a.a. r.128, univ. of southampton, 1960..Wexperimental study of the random vibrations of an aircraftstructure excited by jet noise .  recordings have been made of the strains induced in afull scale rear fuselage test structure of the caravelleair-liner when one jet engine is running at maximumtake-off thrust .  the analysis has been concentrated on thestrains in the centres of panels .  correlationmeasurements indicate that the larger panel strains occur aboveresonance peak in each panel has been identified with thefundamental stringer-twisting mode but the mode-shapes forthe two smaller peaks have not been completely determined .an attempt has been made to calculate the panel resonantfrequencies theoretically .
