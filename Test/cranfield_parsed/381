the axisymmetric boundary layer on a long thin cylinder ..Aglauert,m.b. and lighthill,m.j..Bproc. roy. soc. a, 230, 1955, 188..Wthe axisymmetric boundary layer on a long thin cylinder .the laminar boundary layer in axial flow abouta long thin cylinder is investigated by twomethods .  one (2) is a pohlhausen method,based on a velocity profile chosen to representconditions near the surface as accurately aspossible .  the other (3) is an asymptotic seriessolution, valid far enough downstream fromthe nose for the boundary-layer thickness tohave become large compared with the cylinderradius .  another series solution (due to seban,bond and kelly) is known, valid near enoughto the nose for the boundary layer to be thincompared with the cylinder radius .  thepohlhausen solution shows good agreement withboth series, near and far from the nose, andenables an interpolation to be made (4) betweenthem in the extensive range of distances fromthe nose for which neither is applicable .  thefinal recommended curves, for the variationalong the cylinder of skin friction,boundary-layer displacement area and momentum defectarea, are displayed in graphical and tabularform (figure 1 and table 1) and are expected tobe correct to within about 2 .  the velocity near the wall is closely proportionalto the logarithm of the distance from theaxis,. this is the profile used in the pohlhausenmethod .  the analogy with the distributionof mean velocity in turbulent flow over a flatplate is discussed at the end of 2 .
