an experimental and theoretical investigation of second-orderwing-body interference at high mach number ..Awilby,p.g..Bffa r.91, stockholm, 1962..Wan experimental and theoretical investigation of second-orderwing-body interference at high mach number .  the second-order wing-body interference theoryof landahl and beane is used in thetheoretical calculation of the pressure distributionsover the wing of a wing-body combination .results are compared with experimental valuesobtained from wind-tunnel tests, at a machnumber of 7.35, on a cone-cylinder non-lifting bodywith a triangular wing of wedge sectionset at incidences of 0, 3, 6 and 10 .  it is shownthat interference effects can be very largeand can be calculated theoretically with good accuracy .
