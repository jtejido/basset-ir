the effect of helium injection at an axially symmetric stagnationpoint ..Ah. hoshizaki and h. j. smith.Bmissile and space division, lockheed aircraft corporation,sunnyvale, calif..Wthe effect of helium injection at an axially symmetric stagnationpoint .an effective means of protecting the surface of a hypersonic re-entryvehicle is to inject small quantities of a lightweight gas into theboundary layer through a porous wall .  this process, which is knownas mass-transfer cooling, protects the surface in two ways .  firstof all, as the injected gas or coolant passes from the reservoir throughthe wall to the surface, a considerable quantity of heat is absorbed asits temperature is raised from the reservoir temperature to the wallsurface temperature .  characteristically, lightweight gases haverelatively high specific heats .secondly, the transfer of mass and enthalpy by convection and diffusionnormal to the surface alters the characteristics of the boundarylayer in such a manner as to reduce the temperature gradient at thewall, and, hence, the conductive heat transfer at the wall .  this issometimes referred to as the blowing effect .
