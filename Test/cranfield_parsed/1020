note on creep buckling of columns ..A.B.Wnote on creep buckling of columns .  the results of short-timecreep-buckling and creep-bending tests ofslenderness ratio 111 are presented .the tests were performed at 600 f,and strain measurements were takenwith high-temperature electric-resistancestrain gages .  a descriptionof the development of the gages is givenin an appendix .  the columntests show that the critical time decreasesmuch more rapidly withincreasing load than with increasing initialdeviation from straightness .the bending tests indicate that the steadycreep rate of the curvatureis a simple power function of appliedmoment .  these latter results,together with a previously derivedcreep-buckling theory, are used todevelop a semiempirical formula suitableas a guide for the determinationof the critical time for columns .
