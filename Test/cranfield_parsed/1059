the nonlinear conical spring ..Aschmidt,r. and wempner,g.a..Basme trans. 81e, 1959, 681..Wthe nonlinear conical spring .  the large symmetric deformations of shallow conical shells areof interest in the design of nonlinear conical disk springs .  in mostapplications a uniformly distributed axial load acts at the innerand outer edges,. these edges are otherwise free .  severalapproximations have been proposed to describe the behavior ofthese springs .  a first approximation (1) is based on theassumption that meridional strains are negligible .  this requires that theshell remain conical after deformation and also that theextensional strain of meridional lines on the middle surface vanish .another approximation (2) retains only the assumption that theshell remains conical .  the first assumption satisfies neither ofthe two boundary conditions at the free edges,. the latterviolates the condition of vanishing moment at the free edges .recently the authors presented a series solution (3) for a specialcase, namely, the case of an annular plate under similar loading .numerical solutions for the shallow conical shell under theseconditions of load have also been obtained (4) .  an examinationof these results indicates that the meridional bending stresses areof much smaller magnitude than the circumferential bendingstresses .  hence the present analysis is based on the neglect of themeridional bending moment .
