leading edge attachment in transonic flow with laminaror turbulent boundary layers ..Amabey,d.g..Bj. ae. scs. 29, 1962..Wleading edge attachment in transonic flow with laminaror turbulent boundary layers .  the transonic flow round a two-dimensional airfoil atincidence is often determined by the type of flow in the leading-edgeregion .  if the flow separates at the leading edge at low speeds itis liable to attach as the speed increases, often quite suddenly .a review of this change with laminar or with turbulent boundarylayers re-emphasizes the importance of fixing transition whenmaking model tests at transonic speeds in order to obtain flowsclosest to full-scale conditions .  it is shown that similar airfoils with attached leading-edgeflow show transonic similarity upstream of the terminal shock .
