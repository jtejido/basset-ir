numerical construction of detached shock waves ..Agarabedian,p.r..Bj.math.phys. 36, 1957, 192..Wnumerical construction of detached shock waves .  this article proposes a new method for solving the problemof the detached shock wave .  if the shock wave is assumedknown, a cauchy problem for a system of partial differentialequations arises .  this has been solved by several authorsin the region where the system is elliptic (near the peak ofthe shock wave) .  considering the plane stationary case, theauthor seeks an analytic continuation of the propagationfunction (x,y) in the complex plane y = y1 + y2, x real .in the plane (x, y2) the propagation function satisfies ahyperbolic equation (near the peak of the shock wave) .  anew cauchy problem is solved and the solution of the originalproblem obtained by analytic continuation .  a numericalexample is treated with many details .
