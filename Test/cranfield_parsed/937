on the buckling of truncated conical shells in torsion ..Aseide,p..Bj.app.mech.28, 1962..Won the buckling of truncated conical shells in torsion .the problem of the buckling of thin circularconical frustums in pure torsion is solved ina manner similar to that employed previouslyby the author for buckling under uniformhydrostatic pressure .  synthesis of the numericalresults indicates that the critical torsionof a truncated cone is equal to that of anequivalent cylinder whose length and thicknessare the axial length and wall thickness ofthe cone and whose radius is a function of thesemivertex angle and the taper ratio of thecone .  curves and equations to aid in theanalysis of conical frustums are given .it is shown that a previous recommendation forthe analysis of truncated cones in torsionmay be seriously unconservative in some cases .
