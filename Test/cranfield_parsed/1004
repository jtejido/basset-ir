free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic ..A.B.Wfree-flight measurements of the static and dynamic .  the effects of contamination of helium by air upon static-pressure,total-pressure, heat-transfer, and temperature measurements have beeninvestigated in the 2-inch helium tunnel at the langley researchcenter .  within the scope of the tests, even a small amount of air isshown to affect these measurements .  the heat-transfer and temperaturemeasurements were made on a 26.6 half-angle cone and demonstrated theeffects of contamination qualitatively .  the wall static andcenter-line pitot pressures show that if the contaminating air is held to lessthan about 0.2 percent by volume, the error in indicated mach number isless than 1 percent as calculated from the rayleigh pitot equation .the corresponding errors in wall static and center-line pitot pressuresare about 1.7 and 0.4 percent, respectively .
