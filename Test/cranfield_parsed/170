the interaction of a reflected shock wave with theboundary layer in a shock tube ..Amark,h..Bnaca tm.1418..Wthe interaction of a reflected shock wave with theboundary layer in a shock tube .  ideally, the reflection of a shockfrom the closed end of a shocktube provides, for laboratory study,a quantity of stationary gas atextremely high temperature .  becauseof the action of viscosity, however,the flow in the real case is notone-dimensional, and a boundary layergrows in the fluid following the initial shock wave .  in this paper simplifying assumptionsare made to allow an analysisof the interaction of the shock reflectedfrom the closed end with theboundary layer of the initial shockafterflow .  the analysis predictsthat interactions of several differenttypes will exist in differentranges of initial shock mach number .it is shown that the coolingeffect of the wall on the afterflowboundary layer accounts for the changein interaction type .  an experiment is carried out whichverifies the existence of theseveral interaction regions and showsthat they are satisfactorilypredicted by the theory .  along with theseresults, sufficient informationis obtained from the experiments to makepossible a model for theinteraction in the most complicated case .this model is further verifiedby measurements made during the experiment .  the case of interaction with aturbulent boundary layer is alsoconsidered .  identifying the type ofinteraction with the state ofturbulence of the interacting boundarylayer allows for an estimate of thestate of turbulence of the boundarylayer based on an experimentalinvestigation of the type of interaction .
