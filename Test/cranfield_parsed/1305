a proposed programme of wind tunnel tests at hypersonicspeeds to investigate the lifting properties of geometricallyslender shapes ..Apeckham,d.h..Brae tn.aero.2730..Wa proposed programme of wind tunnel tests at hypersonicspeeds to investigate the lifting properties of geometricallyslender shapes .  a programme of tests at hypersonicspeeds on slender bodies isdescribed, which has the aim ofinvestigating how lift is generated, andthe compromises that may be enforcedby aerodynamic heating .  the programmeis based on models of simple geometricshape, from which liftingconfigurations will later be built up .
