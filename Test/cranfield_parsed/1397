critical shear stress of an infinitely long simplysupported plate with transverse stiffeners ..Astein,m. and fralich,r.w..Bnaca tn.1851, 1949..Wcritical shear stress of an infinitely long simplysupported plate with transverse stiffeners .  a theoretical solution is given for the critical shear stress ofan infinitely long, simply supported, flat plate with identical, equallyspaced, transverse stiffeners of zero torsional stiffness .  results areobtained by means of the lagrangian multiplier method and are presentedin the form of design charts .  experimental results are included andare found to be in good agreement with the theoretical results .
