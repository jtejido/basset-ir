on the prediction of mixed subsonic/supersonic pressuredistributions ..Asinnott,c.s..Bj. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 767..Won the prediction of mixed subsonic/supersonic pressuredistributions .  high-speed wind-tunnel results are analyzed to derive asemiempirical scheme for the prediction of transonic pressuredistributions .  the supersonic and subsonic parts of the flow aretreated separately, and then linked by an empirical shockpressure rise relation .  the significance of the empirical results isconsidered in relation to the physical mechanism of transonicflows .  it is also shown that theoretical solutions can beimproved by introducing the empirical shock relation .
