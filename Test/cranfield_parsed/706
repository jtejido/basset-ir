on som reciprocal relations in the theory of nonstationary flows ..Agarrick, i.e..Bnaca rep. 629. 1938 ..Won som reciprocal relations in the theory of nonstationary flows .in the theory of nonstationary flows about airfoils, the /indicial lift/ function k /s/ of wagner and the /alternating lift/ function c /k/ oftheodorsen have fundamental significance . this paper reports on someinteresting relations of the nature of fourier transforms that existbetween these functions . general problems in transient flows aboutairfoils may be given a unified broad treatment when these functions are employed . certain approximate results also are reported which are ofnotable simplicity, and an analogy with transient electrical flows isdrawn .
