turbulent mixing of a rocket exhaust jet with a supersonic streamincluding chemical reactions ..Avasilu, j..Bj. aero. sc. v. 29, january 1962, pp 19-28 ..Wturbulent mixing of a rocket exhaust jet with a supersonic streamincluding chemical reactions .the equations for the turbulent mixing of a two-dimensional supersonicjet issuing into an ambient supersonic stream are formulated . bothstreams consist of a mixture of chemically active and possibly reactinggases, therefore any heat release by chemical reaction is included,. the net mass rate of production of species is obtained on the assumptionthat the reaction rate constant is given by an expression reducible tothe classical arrhenius law . the equations first given in terms of thex, and y coordinates, are expressed in dimensionless form and in termsof the x and coordinates, where is the stream function . the resultingexpressions are all of the /heat conduction/ type,. they are put in afinite difference form by using the crank-nicolson method ofsubstituting finite difference approximations for both the /time/ and /space/derivatives . the mixture is assumed to consist of six species, namelyh2o, h2, o2, co2, co, and n2, and the oxidation of h2 and co is assumedto take place according to a single-step chemical reaction . thesolution of the problem is based on the simultaneous solution of 8n linearalgebraic equations in 8n unknowns, n being the number of internal gridpoints at every step in the x-direction, and 8 the total number ofunknowns at each grid point, namely velocity, temperature, andconcentration for each of the six species . a method of obtaining initial andboundary conditions from available inviscid jet flow solutions isdiscussed . the equations are programed for calculation on an ibm-704computer . finally, one typical case is considered, and plots of velocity,temperature, and concentration profiles are given for the initial stages of development of the mixing layer .
