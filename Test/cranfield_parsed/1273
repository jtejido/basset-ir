magnetohydrodynamic effects on the formation of couette,flow ..Atao,l.n..Bj. ae. scs. 1960, 334..Wmagnetohydrodynamic effects on the formation of couette,flow .  this paper is concerned with the problem of the formation ofcouette flow--i.e., the problem of how the velocity profile varieswith the time tending asymptotically to that of the steady flow ofan electrically conducting viscous fluid in the presence of amagnetic field .  the governing equations and boundary conditionsare established and discussed .  the cases of both vanishing andnonvanishing mean induced electric field strengths are solved interms of complimentary error functions as well as someelementary functions .  it is shown that the solutions are reducible tothat of the steady case as the time approaches infinity, and to thatof the nonmagnetic field as the hartmann number becomes zero .some numerical calculations are given .  the results indicatethat in the presence of a magnetic field the flow rate is reduceddepending on the magnitude of the hartmann number, and thatthe magnetic field /assists/ the flow to reach its steadycondition .
