reaction-resisted shock fronts ..Aclarke,j.f..Bcoa r.150, 1961..Wreaction-resisted shock fronts .  it is shown that shock waves whosestructure is determined solely by the effectsof chemical reactions (reaction-resistedshock fronts) are possible and completelyanalogous to relaxation - resisted waves .a single dissociation reaction is consideredand numerical results indicate that suchwaves could be observed experimentally .bulk viscosities equivalent to reactioneffects are possibly 10 or more times shearviscosity values .  (examples are based onlighthill's ideal dissociating gas) .
